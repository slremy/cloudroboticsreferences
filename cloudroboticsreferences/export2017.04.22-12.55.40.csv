We have built an application called 'ECG Android App' which provides the end user with visualization of their Electro Cardiogram (ECG) waves and data logging functionality in the background. The logged data can be uploaded to the user's private centralized cloud or a specific medical cloud, which keeps a record of all the monitored data and can be retrieved for analysis by the medical personnel. Though the idea of building a medical application using IoT and cloud techniques is not totally new, there is a lack of empirical studies in building such a system. This paper reviews the fundamental concepts of IoT. Further, the paper presents an infrastructure for the healthcare domain, which consists of various technologies: IOIO microcontroller, signal processing, communication protocols, secure and efficient mechanisms for large file transfer, data base management system, and the centralized cloud. The paper emphasizes on the system and software architecture and design which is essential to overall IoT and cloud based medical applications. The infrastructure presented in the paper can also be applied to other healthcare domains.

Sensor cloud: SmartComponent framework for reconfigurable diagnostics in intelligent manufacturing environments,L. Neto; J. Reis; D. GuimarÃ£es; G.

The concept of Sensor Cloud has emerged as the cornerstone for enabling the integration of nearly real time data sources into Service Oriented Architectures and as one of the enablers for Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems. Hitherto there are still some challenges that need to be tackled, namely the on-the-fly instantiation and update of services at the system level and the dynamic (re)organization of the services created. This paper presents the first steps in the development of a framework (taking advantage of several technologies like UPnP, OSGi and iPOJO) to address these challenges and make Sensor Clouds a reality in the shop floor. The results from the first implementation reveal that the performance of the system is linear in terms of scalability, and from these scalability tests, we proved the framework's robustness and consistent responsiveness.",1935-4576;19354576,Electronic:978-1-4799-6649-3; POD:978-1-4799-6650-9; USB:978-1-4799-6648-6,10.1109/INDIN.2015.7281991,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7281991,,Computer architecture;Context;Manufacturing systems;Monitoring;Robot sensing systems;Scalability;Software,cloud computing;fault diagnosis;intelligent manufacturing systems;production engineering computing,SmartComponent framework;intelligent manufacturing environments;reconfigurable diagnostics;reconfigurable manufacturing systems;scalability tests;sensor cloud concept;sensor networks;service oriented architecture;shop floor,,1,,15,,,22-24 July 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Lots of technical challenges of cloud robotics remain to be worked out. For example, the computation challenges, the communication challenges, and the security challenges. In this paper we intend to design an optimal execution framework for the cloud robotics under MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) wireless channel model, which aims to minimize the energy consumption of the robot and extend the battery lifetime. The model of the energy consumption for cloud execution is derived, and the problem of optimization is analyzed during the process. Additionally, a model and optimization of the standalone execution by robot are proposed. Based on the models, we provide a theoretical framework, which decide whether to offloading task.

Multi-agent trajectory tracking with self-triggered cloud access,A. Adaldo; D. Liuzza; D. V. Dimarogonas; K. H. Johansson,"Department of Automatic Control and ACCESS Linnaeus Center, School of Electrical Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Osquldas v&#x00E4;g 10, 10044, Stockholm, Sweden",2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),20161229,2016,,,2207,2214,"This paper presents a cloud-supported control algorithm for coordinated trajectory tracking of networked autonomous agents. The motivating application is the coordinated control of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles. The control objective is to have the vehicles track a reference trajectory while keeping an assigned formation. Rather than relying on inter-agent communication, which is interdicted underwater, coordination is achieved by letting the agents intermittently access a shared information repository hosted on a cloud.

They are widely used in several areas (e.g., healthcare, disaster management, and manufacturing). However, their provisioning still faces several challenges such as cost and resource usage efficiency. Cloud computing is an emerging paradigm that may aid in tackling these challenges. It has three main facets: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). This paper focuses on the IaaS aspects of robotic applications as cloud computing services. It proposes an architecture that enables cost efficiency through virtualization and dynamic task delegation to robots, including robots that might belong to other clouds. Overlays and RESTful Web services are used as cornerstones. A prototype is built using LEGO Mindstorms NXT as the robotic platform, and JXTA as the overlay middleware.

Toward Hyper Interconnected IoT World Using SDN Overlay Network for NGN Seamless Mobility,W. F. Elsadek,"Dept. of Comput. Sci. & Eng., American Univ. in Cairo, New Cairo, Egypt",2016 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science (CloudCom),20170126,2016,,,460,463,"Existing mobility protocols adopt centralized gateways and proxies to ensure session continuity for mobile users. The centralized architecture and the absence of effective selective traffic offload mechanism lead to inefficient data forwarding plane that congested the 4G Evolved Packet Core (EPC). Despite the tremendous ongoing efforts of 3GPP, IETF, vendors, and researchers, these problems still persist and restrict operators' offering for residential/enterprise indoor services extension and mobility deployments for session continuity in wide area motion as train or cars when crossing cities' boundaries. Moreover, latest advancements in cognitive services requiring real time collaborative interactions between moving users, server, and IoT smart terminals as drones, robots, smart vehicles ...etc attached to 5G edges can never be satisfied with existing protocols. This paper presents an initiative to a new mobility paradigm based on OpenFlow Software Defined Network (SDN) based technology to solve existing mobility problems, satisfy IoT collaborative interactions, and extend mobility coverage cross service providers under Service Level Agreements (SLAs) while ensuring the involved entities' privacy. Mobility is achieved through dynamic establishment of SDN overlay network that can cross any type of LAN/WAN/Cellular topology. Initial results show that join delay range is 0.2s in fully migrated SDN network and 1.5s in standard operator with direct home network SLA while the rest of packets are forwarded at almost wire speed.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-1445-3; POD:978-1-5090-1446-0,10.1109/CloudCom.2016.0078,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7830719,Cognitive Service;Collaborative interactions;IoT;LIPA;MIP;Mobility;SIPTO;SLA;Wide Area Motion,,4G mobile communication;5G mobile communication;Internet of Things;cellular radio;computer network security;contracts;home networks;local area networks;mobility management (mobile radio);next generation networks;overlay networks;packet radio networks;protocols;software defined networking;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;wide area networks,3GPP;4G EPC;4G evolved packet core;5G edges;IETF;IoT smart terminals;LAN-WAN-cellular topology;NGN seamless mobility;OpenFlow software defined network;SDN overlay network;centralized architecture;cognitive services;data forwarding plane;direct home network SLA;entity privacy;hyper interconnected IoT world;indoor services;mobile users;mobility coverage cross service providers;mobility deployments;mobility protocols;moving users;packet forwarding;real time collaborative interactions;selective traffic offload mechanism;service level agreements;session continuity;wide area motion,,,,,,,12-15 Dec. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Remote system controlling, Data processing and Record keeping are some of them. The system is synced to an online cloud database and it stores every action done by ASRS. Also the system is capable of categorizing the products into specific order. This is useful for production floors which has more than one product in a production line. Moreover, anyone can view the processes and the history of the system through a user interface. The simple and animated user interfaces are designed for personal computers and for android devices. The simplicity of the concept makes the system speed and it consumes minimum resources.

Task definitions such as explicit robot programs are hardly reusable from an application point-of-view. To improve the situation, a knowledge-based approach exploiting distributed declarative information and cloud computing offers many possibilities for knowledge exchange and reuse, and it has the potential to facilitate new business models for industrial solutions. However, there are many unresolved questions yet, e.g., those related to reliability, consistency, or legal responsibility. To investigate some of these issues, different knowledge-based architectures have been prototyped and evaluated by confronting the solution candidates with key application demands.

Assuring Mobile Physical Services for the New Generation of Networks,Y. Chen,"Sch. of Comput., Inf. & Decision Syst. Eng., Arizona State Univ., Tempe, AZ, USA",2011 Tenth International Symposium on Autonomous Decentralized Systems,20110405,2011,,,585,588,"The development of computing and communication systems has gone through a spiral cycle of centralization and decentralization schemas. The earliest telephone network used decentralized point-to-point connections. It moved to centralized switching system as the number of devices increased. The centralized computing and communication systems further moved into a decentralized paradigm, as devices expand and dependability of large systems becomes a dominating factor. The current cloud computing and communication systems appear to be a centralized system where computing and communication resources are not in the client computers but in an integrated infrastructure. Nevertheless, the implementation of the centralized infrastructure is equipped with decentralized and redundant resources, which makes the system more dependable as any internal failures can be tolerated internally. However, the terminal devices and their interfaces to the centralized infrastructure remain vulnerable to the single-point-of-failures. This paper focuses on terminal devices and their interfaces to the new generation of assurance network and presents the challenges of making the devices and the interfaces as dependable as the assurance network. The idea of achieving the goal is through a pool of Mobile Physical Services (MPS) that can connect to multiple networks and can be shared by neighboring users.",1541-0056;15410056,Electronic:978-0-7695-4349-9; POD:978-1-61284-213-4,10.1109/ISADS.2011.83,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5741430,New generation network;cloud computing;cyber-physical system;mobile physical service;robot as a service,Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Conferences;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Robot sensing systems,next generation networks;radio links;switching networks;telecommunication computing,assurance network;centralized switching;communication resources;communication systems;computing systems;decentralized point-to-point connections;internal failures;mobile physical services;multiple networks;new generation networks;redundant resources;spiral cycle;telephone network,,1,,20,,,23-27 March 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Design for a cloud-based hybrid Android application security assessment framework,H. Zhong; J.

Billions of Android apps are held on different public app markets or private repositories which needs an integrated procedure to control the security risks for the applications submitted from developers. To ensure the delivery of safe applications, the developers also need to identify potential security issues within the applications before the submissions. The industry lacks of an approach that can provide accurate, efficient and agile security assessment for Android applications. Based on the concept of data fusion, we design a hybrid assessment framework that combines white-box, black-box assessment and environmental forensic techniques. The proposed hybrid assessment framework is aimed to improve the overall assessment quality by harmonizing the merits of various conventional assessment techniques into an integrated system. Moreover, as security analysis usually requires databases with large volume of signature information and huge computing capacity used for vulnerability searching, the difficulty of the assessment is even increased if the application developers and inspectors are geographically distributed.

In this work, we describe the RoboEarth semantic mapping system. The semantic map is composed of: 1) an ontology to code the concepts and relations in maps and objects and 2) a SLAM map providing the scene geometry and the object locations with respect to the robot. We propose to ground the terminological knowledge in the robot perceptions by means of the SLAM map of objects. RoboEarth boosts mapping by providing: 1) a subdatabase of object models relevant for the task at hand, obtained by semantic reasoning, which improves recognition by reducing computation and the false positive rate; 2) the sharing of semantic maps between robots; and 3) software as a service to externalize in the cloud the more intensive mapping computations, while meeting the mandatory hard real time constraints of the robot. To demonstrate the RoboEarth cloud mapping system, we investigate two action recipes that embody semantic map building in a simple mobile robot. The first recipe enables semantic map building for a novel environment while exploiting available prior information about the environment. The second recipe searches for a novel object, with the efficiency boosted thanks to the reasoning on a semantically annotated map. Our experimental results demonstrate that, by using RoboEarth cloud services, a simple robot can reliably and efficiently build the semantic maps needed to perform its quotidian tasks. In addition, we show the synergetic relation of the SLAM map of objects that grounds the terminological knowledge coded in the ontology.",1545-5955;15455955,,10.1109/TASE.2014.2377791,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7015601,Cloud mapping;knowledge representation;object recognition;semantic mapping;visual SLAM,Knowledge based systems;Navigation;Search problems;Semantics;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Visualization,SLAM (robots);Web services;cloud computing;control engineering computing;intelligent robots;mobile robots;object recognition;ontologies (artificial intelligence),RoboEarth semantic mapping system;SLAM map;Web services;cloud enabled knowledge-based approach;cloud services;intelligent robot;mobile robot;object locations;object model subdatabase;ontology;scene geometry;semantic reasoning;software as a service,,11,,52,,20150120,Apr-15,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Supporting consumer services in a deterministic industrial internet core network,T. H. Szymanski,McMaster University,IEEE Communications Magazine,20160623,2016,54,6,110,117,"A convergence is occurring in the networking world. Industrial networks currently provide deterministic services in robotic factories and aircraft, while the best effort Internet of Things provides best effort services for consumers. We argue that a convergence should occur, and that a future converged Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) should support both best effort and deterministic services, with very low latency and jitter. This article presents the design of a deterministic IIoT core network consisting of many simple deterministic packet switches configured by an SDN control plane. The use of deterministic communications can reduce router buffer sizes by a factor of â‰¥ 1000, and can reduce end-to-end latencies to the speed of light in fiber. A speed-of-light deterministic core network can have a profound impact on virtually all consumer services such as multimedia distribution, e-Commerce, and cloud computing or gaming systems. Highly aggregated video streams can be delivered over a deterministic virtual network with very high link utilization (â‰_ 100 percent), very low packet jitter (â‰_ 10 Î_s), and zero congestion. In addition to improving consumer services, a converged deterministic IIoT core network can save billions of dollars per year as a result of significantly improved network utilization and energy efficiency.",0163-6804;01636804,,10.1109/MCOM.2016.7498096,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498096,,Automation;IP networks;Internet;Internet of Things;Packet switching;Service robots;Streaming media,Internet;Internet of Things;customer services;packet switching;software defined networking;telecommunication network routing,SDN control plane;Tactile Internet;aircraft;cloud computing;consumer services;deterministic IIoT core network;deterministic communications;deterministic industrial internet core network;deterministic packet switches;deterministic virtual network;e-commerce;energy efficiency;gaming systems;industrial Internet of Things;link utilization;low packet jitter;multimedia distribution;network utilization;robotic factories;router buffer size reduction;software defined networking;speed-of-light deterministic core network;video streams;zero congestion,,1,,,,,Jun-16,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Transient Clouds are utilized in temporal scenarios in which the cloud is created on-the-fly by the devices present in an environment and would disappear as the devices leave the network. In Transient Clouds, each device offers a different set of capabilities based on its software and hardware. When a particular device has a task to execute, it can send it into the Transient Cloud that would assign the subtasks to the devices, based on their capabilities, and collect the results back. We use a modified version of the Hungarian method to decide the assignments to achieve certain properties such as load balancing and collocating subtasks. This demo showcases an implementation of a Transient Cloud, albeit limited by Android's Wi-Fi Direct framework, in which a number of devices provide their capabilities as a cloud service.

We describe the design of a tablet capable of 3D vision and a glasses free stereoscopic display, which can be used to enhance the working of the technicians performing micromanipulations. We also illustrate how by providing a deep integration with the cloud, we can reduce the processing overheads and enable valuable new services. For example, in case of microsurgeries, the process is very specialized and is done in a few specialized medical centers only. When these powerful mobile devices are coupled with the cloud, it adds whole new dimension in the services which can be offered. With our deep cloud integration, the surgery being performed can be streamed in realtime from the Tablet itself. This live feed can be viewed by a remote expert to provide guidance to the surgeon.

A Hierarchical Auction-Based Mechanism for Real-Time Resource Allocation in Cloud Robotic Systems,L. Wang; M. Liu; M. Q. H. Meng,"School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore",IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics,20170116,2017,47,2,473,484,"Cloud computing enables users to share computing resources on-demand. The cloud computing framework cannot be directly mapped to cloud robotic systems with ad hoc networks since cloud robotic systems have additional constraints such as limited bandwidth and dynamic structure. However, most multirobotic applications with cooperative control adopt this decentralized approach to avoid a single point of failure. Robots need to continuously update intensive data to execute tasks in a coordinated manner, which implies real-time requirements. Thus, a resource allocation strategy is required, especially in such resource-constrained environments. This paper proposes a hierarchical auction-based mechanism, namely link quality matrix (LQM) auction, which is suitable for ad hoc networks by introducing a link quality indicator. The proposed algorithm produces a fast and robust method that is accurate and scalable. It reduces both global communication and unnecessary repeated computation. The proposed method is designed for firm real-time resource retrieval for physical multirobot systems. A joint surveillance scenario empirically validates the proposed mechanism by assessing several practical metrics. The results show that the proposed LQM auction outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for resource allocation.",2168-2267;21682267,,10.1109/TCYB.2016.2519525,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403967,Cloud robotics;hierarchical auction;real-time resource allocation,Ad hoc networks;Cloud computing;Real-time systems;Resource management;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems,cloud computing;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;resource allocation,LQM auction;ad hoc networks;cloud computing framework;cloud robotic systems;cooperative control;dynamic structure;hierarchical auction-based mechanism;joint surveillance scenario;link quality indicator;link quality matrix;multirobotic applications;physical multirobot systems;real-time resource allocation;real-time resource retrieval;resource-constrained environments;robots,,2,,,,20160211,Feb. 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Our method uses sampling cloud for allocating samples on promising regions. Our sampling cloud consists of a set of spheres containing a portion of the C-space. In particular, each sphere projects to a collision-free spherical region in the workspace. We initialize our sampling cloud by conducting a workspace analysis based on the generalized Voronoi graph. We then update our sampling cloud to refine the current best solution, while maintaining the global sampling distribution for exploring understudied other homotopy classes. We have applied our method to a 2D motion planning problem with kinematic constraints, i.e., the Dubins vehicle model, and compared it against the state-of-the-art methods.

Participatory Cyber Physical System in Public Transport Application,J. K. S. Lau; C. K. Tham; T. Luo,"Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Nat.

This scenario leads us to the many challenges faced by public transportation since it is directly linked to urbanization. From a civilian point of view, proper travel planning and knowledge of others' travel experiences are useful in easing public transportation woes. We apply Cyber Physical System (CPS) within cyber-physical-socio space to make those capabilities possible. In this approach, we regard data as a service, data are contributed and queried by the public masses. Location and time represent the physical domain and data with information derived from them represent the digital domain in our CPS design. We designed and implemented a prototypical system named ContriSenseCloud that works based on client-server model. The system has two main distinctive platforms, namely Service Exchange Platform (SEP) and Application-specific Exchange Platform (AEP). The SEP is designed to be as generalizable as possible whereas AEP is where our current public transportation applications reside. Such architecture enables extensibility of ContriSenseCloud to other application domains. Other contributions include Restful Application Programming Interface (API) in CPS, near real-time sensing, and mapping of GPS readings to correct sequence of bus stops.",,Electronic:978-0-7695-4592-9; POD:978-1-4577-2116-8,10.1109/UCC.2011.59,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6123523,Cyber physical society;Cyber physical system;Data as a service;Participatory sensing;Public transportation,Androids;Databases;Global Positioning System;Humanoid robots;Real time systems;Sensors;Servers,Global Positioning System;application program interfaces;client-server systems;data handling;traffic information systems;transportation,CPS digital domain;ContriSenseCloud system;GPS reading mapping;application programming interface;application specific exchange platform;client-server model;cyber physical system;cyber-physical-socio space;public transportation;service exchange platform;travel experience sharing;travel planning;urbanization,,13,,16,,,5-8 Dec. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Estimating part tolerance bounds based on adaptive Cloud-based grasp planning with slip,B. Kehoe; D. Berenson; K.

We consider the most common robot gripper: a pair of thin parallel jaws, and a conservative class of push-grasps allowing slip that can enhance part alignment for parts that can be modeled as extruded polygons. The grasp analysis algorithm takes as input a set of candidate grasps and perturbations of a nominal part shape. We define a grasp quality metric based on a lower bound on the probability of achieving force closure. We present two extensions to our previous highly-parallelizable algorithm that adaptively reduce the number of grasp evaluations and improve the lower bound by including slip. We develop a procedure for finding the effect of increasing tolerance in vertices on grasp quality, which allows part tolerances to be bounded to ensure minimum grasp quality levels. We find that including slip improves grasp quality estimates by 16%, and our adaptive extension reduces grasp evaluations by 91.5% while maintaining 92.6% of grasp quality.",2161-8070;21618070,Electronic:978-1-4673-0430-6; POD:978-1-4673-0429-0,10.1109/CoASE.2012.6386393,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6386393,,Algorithm design and analysis;Force;Grasping;Grippers;Planning;Robot sensing systems,Monte Carlo methods;cloud computing;computational geometry;control engineering computing;grippers;slip,Monte Carlo method;adaptive cloud-based grasp planning algorithm;cloud computing;force closure;grasp analysis algorithm;grasp evaluations;grasp quality metric;part alignment enhancement;part tolerance bound estimation;push-grasps;robot gripper;slip;thin parallel jaws,,7,,37,,,20-24 Aug. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

It allows different types of robots to share information and develop new skills even without specific sensors. They can also perform intensive tasks by combining multiple robots with a cooperative manner. Multi-sensor data retrieval is one of the fundamental tasks for resource sharing demanded by Cloud Robotic system. However, many technical challenges persist, for example Multi-Sensor Data Retrieval (MSDR) is particularly difficult when Cloud Cluster Hosts accommodate unpredictable data requested by multi robots in parallel. Moreover, the synchronization of multi-sensor data mostly requires near real-time response of different message types. In this paper, we describe a MSDR framework which is comprised of priority scheduling method and buffer management scheme. It is validated by assessing the quality of service (QoS) model in the sense of facilitating data retrieval management.

Robots have to synchronize tasks or to share poses and sensor readings with other agents, especially for co-operative mapping task where local sensor readings are incorporated into a global map. The drawback of existing communication frameworks is that most are based on a central component which has to be constantly within reach. Additionally, they do not prevent data loss between robots if a failure occurs in the communication link. During a distributed mapping task, loss of data is critical because it will corrupt the global map. In this work, we propose a cloud-based publish/subscribe mechanism which enables reliable communication between agents during a cooperative mission using the Data Distribution Service (DDS) as a transport layer.

Since the texts of microblog messages are limited, people post URLs to link to other websites for detailed information. Hence, URLs with higher attentions are spread widely and represent popular information. However, not all these URLs are useful. Many of them are spam URLs which are posted by automated agents or by pushing services from other websites automatically. Based on the features of the popular URLs, we divide them into four categories and propose a clustering and classification algorithm to distinguish spam URLs from the really popular ones. Comparative experiments are conducted on English (Twitter) and Chinese (Sina Weibo) messages. We conclude that more than half of the popular URLs are spam. Most of them are pushed from other websites; even the really popular ones gain much attention from the pushing services. Although the proportions of URLs in Twitter and Sina Weibo messages are different, the characteristics of the spam URLs are similar.

The application we developed provide the functionality to store messages to cloud and anyone anytime can retrieve those messages, provided he/she knows the key. Also, the user can store the apps information installed in device and retrieve them whenever there is a need. Additionally, it can also be effective in case of system failure. This would create a new revolution in smartphone era, where no one will lose his apps and reduce the time of cost related to circulating a particular message among many.

We select appropriate decompiling tools to decompile the ad plugins to get the Java files that we need. And then we traverse the Java files to count the unique word of each file. The number of the unique word is the digital sequence of the file which could be applied as the feature of machine learning classifier to detect ad plugins.

Moessner,"School of Software and Electrical Engineering, Swinburne University of Technology, VIC 3122, Australia",2015 International Telecommunication Networks and Applications Conference (ITNAC),20160104,2015,,,308,313,"Nowadays, smart environments (e.g., smart home, smart city) are built heavily relying on Cloud computing for the coordination and collaboration among smart objects. Cloud is typically centralized but smart objects are ubiquitously distributed, thus, data transmission latency (i.e., end-to-end delay or response time) between Cloud and smart objects is a critical issue especially to the applications that have strict delay requirements. To address the concern, a new Fog computing paradigm is recently proposed by the industry, while the detailed Fog platform is yet to be developed. The key idea is to bring the computing power from the remote Cloud closer to the users, which further enables real-time interaction and location-based services. In particular, the local processing capability of Fog computing significantly scales down the data volume towards the Cloud, and it in turn has great impacts on the entire Internet. In this paper, a data-centered Fog platform is developed to support smart living together with dataflow analysis. Case studies are also conducted to validate and evaluate the proposed platform.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-9348-5; POD:978-1-4673-9349-2,10.1109/ATNAC.2015.7366831,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366831,Cloud Computing;Fog Computing;Smart Living,Cloud computing;Medical services;Real-time systems;Robots;Servers,cloud computing;computer centres,EHOPES;Fog computing paradigm;Internet;cloud computing;data transmission latency;data-centered fog platform;dataflow analysis;location-based service;smart living;smart object,,1,,24,,,18-20 Nov. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this setting, a central cloud computer is responsible for aggregating information, computing dual variable updates, and distributing these updates to the agents. The agents update their (primal) state variables and also communicate among themselves with each agent sharing and receiving state information with some number of its neighbors.

In order to overcome this problem, the networked visual servo control (NVSC), which integrates networked computational resources for cloud image processing, is considered in this paper. The main contributions of this paper are the following: 1) a real-time transport protocol for transmitting large-volume image data on a cloud-computing platform, which enables high-sampling-rate visual feedback; 2) a stabilizing control law for the NVSC system with time-varying feedback time delay; and 3) a sending rate scheduling strategy aiming at reducing the communication network load. The performance of the NVSC system with sending rate scheduling is validated in an object-tracking scenario on a 14-DOF dual-arm robot. Experimental results show the superior performance of our approach.

How to save huge amounts of data is of great importance to both industry and academia. This paper puts forward a solution based on coding technologies in big data system that store a lot of cold data. By studying existing coding technologies and big data systems, we can not only maintain the system's reliability, but also improve the security and the utilization of storage systems. Due to the remarkable reliability and space saving rate of coding technologies, importing coding schema in to big data systems becomes prerequisite. In our presented schema, the storage node is divided into several virtual nodes to keep load balancing. By setting up different virtual node storage groups for different codec server, we can ensure system availability. And by utilizing the parallel decoding computing of the node and the block of data, we can also reduce the system recovery time when data is corrupted. Additionally, different users set different coding parameters can improve the robustness of big data storage systems. We configure various data block m and calibration block k to improve the utilization rate in the quantitative experiments. The results shows that parallel decoding speed can rise up two times than the past serial decoding speed. The encoding efficiency with ICRS coding is 34.2% higher than using CRS and 56.5% more than using RS coding equally.

Consequently, one of the approaches is adopted and a detailed simulation is done where an Android client device is shown communicating with a server running openCV and using the Haar face-detection algorithm. The work assures the credibility of the adopted system architecture, in terms of deployment, and several future lines of work are proposed.",,Electronic:978-1-61284-227-1; POD:978-1-61284-226-4,10.1109/DSP-SPE.2011.5739270,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5739270,,Androids;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Servers,Haar transforms;cloud computing;educational computing;face recognition;mobile computing;video signal processing,Android client device;Haar face-detection algorithm;Mobi4Ed;cellular channel;data channel;image processing algorithms;mobile cloud computing educational tool;mobile devices;openCV;video processing algorithms,,12,,14,,,4-7 Jan. 2011,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this paper, a compact approach to identify the size, position and orientation of the patient's head relative to a robotic arm using a non-vision, range data based system is proposed. An accurate distance measurement sensor is used in tandem with a robotic arm to scan the patient's head and produce a growing 3D point cloud. An efficient surface fitting algorithm, taking into consideration the similarity of the human head to an ellipsoid, is presented to simultaneously extract position, orientation and geometrical information of the target head.

Saveme: client-side aggregation of cloud storage,G. Song; S. Kim; D. Seo,"Department of Robot and HCI, University of Science and Technology, Hwarang-ro 14gil 5, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul 136-791, Korea",IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics,20151015,2015,61,3,302,310,"Nowadays, there are many cloud storage service providers and many of them provide significant amounts of free storage. It is desirable for users to be able to manage the storage space available to them as a single unified space. Otherwise, user files will be scattered over many different providers, negating the advantage of using cloud storage. Another important concern of users is that their data is at the disposal of the service providers. Lastly, in contrast to the hype of extremely high availability, accidents tend to happen and even the most available cloud services are not accessible many times per year or even per month. SaveMe is designed to solve all of these issues, providing aggregation, security, and higher availability purely from the client side. It is the first approach to address all three issues without any additional server component. To achieve these goals, SaveMe is building a single virtual volume by combining public and private cloud storage. In SaveMe, every file is fully encrypted, erasure coded, and distributed. For better security and privacy, all data processes are performed on the client side, unlike the case of conventional cloud storage services. The logical volume of SaveMe is extensible due to a flexible data and volume model. The authors also tested the performance of SaveMe in comparison with those of existing services. SaveMe showed above average performance in terms of the speeds of uploading or downloading files. Furthermore, data availability evaluation clearly demonstrates that the availability of SaveMe is an order of magnitude higher than those of other commercial cloud storage services.",0098-3063;00983063,,10.1109/TCE.2015.7298089,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7298089,cloud storage;fault tolerance;privacy;security,Cloud computing;Data models;Encryption;Redundancy;Servers,cloud computing;data privacy;security of data;software reliability;storage management,SaveMe;client-side aggregation;cloud storage service providers;data availability evaluation;data privacy;data process;data security;flexible data;private cloud storage;public cloud storage;server component;single unified space;single virtual volume;storage space management;volume model,,,,22,,,Aug. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

All of the balancing and stability algorithms (the heart of the humanoid) stay onboard the robot. What if we could run high frequency real-time loops over the cloud? The better question is how would we do that? As with any real-time system latency is a big factor in the application and operation frequency.

Social Networking SaaS (SNS) is one of the most popular kinds of SaaS. The key to the success of a SNS heavily relies on the scale of users. With the explosive growth of users, SNS's architecture should be able to change according to the demand. To better understand what kind of requirements influences SNS's architecture most, and learn the relationships between these requirements and the evolution progress of architecture, this paper carried out a dedicated analysis on a popular SNS application, Instagram. The lessons learned show that: 1) Demands on scalability and real-time are the main driven forces to architecture redesign, 2) Data coming from extensive monitoring is one of the most important sources of evolutionary requirements/issues, which drives different types of architecture evolution, 3) Reusing existing components is the key factor to evolve architecture rapidly and costly.

Current mobile device platforms (e.g. Android) have permissions and access control systems designed for mobile apps that are written by reputable developers and vetted by authoritative app stores, and they are not suitable for untrusted apps. We propose STOVEPipe, an observable access control system for user data on mobile devices for untrusted third-party applications. STOVEPipe ensures that untrusted code is isolated and cannot directly access system data, and performs all data accesses on behalf of untrusted apps. This enables STOVEPipe to observe all data accessed by untrusted apps, implement content-based access control, perform accounting and auditing on accessed data easily, and perform privacy-preserving data transformations.",,Electronic:978-1-4799-4093-6; POD:978-1-4799-4092-9; USB:978-1-4799-4094-3,10.1109/CloudCom.2014.118,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7037737,access control;mobile cloud computing;mobile security,Access control;Androids;Data models;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Smart phones,authorisation;data privacy;mobile computing;smart phones,Android;STOVEPipe;authoritative app stores;content-based access control;mobile apps;mobile device platforms;observable access control system;privacy-preserving data transformations;untrusted third-party applications;user data,,0,,23,,,15-18 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Pheromones do not need to be ""physical marks"", and a number of works have investigated the use of digital, virtual pheromones.

Now, industrial and residential applications of the Internet of Things force us to revisit principled deployment and support of distributed sensing and actuation. Web standards provide key resources in the development and support of flexible distributed systems, however the conventional wisdom is that their use adds to the network delay and uncertainty, and makes a difficult control problem intractable. We quantify the effect of an important set of web standards (both formal and informal) in the control of physical systems.

Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan",2013 Seventh International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing,20130919,2013,,,43,50,"Smart mobile devices and wireless networks have reshaped the way people execute applications and access information. Many of today's mobile applications are programmed to rely on cloud services to augment the execution of sophisticated tasks with the assumption that the smartphone does not have enough computational resources to handle the tasks in time. However, the current application development model has several shortcomings. First, it can be difficult for a developer to decide how to partition a mobile application if the application workload cannot be known in advance and will be performed by a wide range of devices. Second, to get an application augmented, the application user is required to subscribe to a service, which causes additional efforts and privacy risks. Third, a mobile application that relies on the support of the server-side can suffer seriously from poor network connectivity. The work described in this paper enhances the current Android application framework to address the aforementioned shortcomings. First, we introduce the notion of personal application cloud (PAC), which is a unified service that the user can use to augment many applications without revealing personal data to the application vendors. Then, we provide an application programming interface and runtime support for the developers to create pervasive, scalable Android applications whose execution and data can be dynamically migrated and scaled to benefit from PAC.

Current offloading schemes either require the programmer's annotations, which restricts its wide application; or transmits too much unnecessary data, resulting bandwidth and energy waste. In this paper, we propose a novel method-level offloading methodology to offload local computational workload with as least data transmission as possible. Our basic idea is to identify the contexts which are necessary to the method execution by parsing application binaries in advance and applying this parsing result to selectively migrate heap data while allowing successful method execution remotely.

Numerical Analysis of Complex Physical Systems on Networked Mobile Devices,C. Dibak; F. DÃ_rr; K. Rothermel,"Inst. of Parallel & Distrib.

Prominent examples of such applications include augmented reality applications visualizing physical processes on a mobile device or mobile cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles or robots. Typically, these applications need to solve partial differential equations (PDE) to simulate the behavior of a physical system. There are two basic strategies to numerically solve these PDEs: (1) offload all computations to a remote server, (2) solve the PDE on the resource-constrained mobile device. However, both strategies have severe drawbacks. Offloading will fail if the mobile device is disconnected, and resource constraints require to reduce the quality of the solution. Therefore, we propose a new approach for mobile simulations using a hybrid strategy that is robust to communication failures and can still benefit from powerful server resources. The basic idea of this approach is to dynamically decide on the placement of the PDE solver based on a prediction of the wireless link availability using Markov Chains. Our tests based on measurement in real cellular networks and real mobile devices show that this approach is able to keep deadline constraints in more than 61 % of the cases compared to a pure offloading approach, while saving up to 74 % of energy compared to a simplified approach.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-9101-6; POD:978-1-4673-9102-3,10.1109/MASS.2015.12,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7366942,augmented reality;mobile cloud computing;mobile cyber-physical systems;numerical applications,Computational modeling;Energy consumption;Handheld computers;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Servers;Wireless communication,Markov processes;cellular radio;mobile handsets;partial differential equations;resource allocation,Markov Chains;PDE solver;cellular networks;complex physical systems numerical analysis;mobile cyber-physical systems;mobile simulations;networked mobile devices;partial differential equations;physical phenomenon;powerful server resources;resource-constrained mobile device;wireless link availability,,,,19,,,19-22 Oct. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

To solve this problem, this paper found that the statistical information of Android components (mainly activity) from the Manifest file cannot be ignored, based on the traditional method of Android permission detection. In this paper, a new feature vector is extracted from the AndroidManifest file, which combines the permission information and the component information of the Android application.

Virtual Smartphone was prototyped as a data leakage prevention solution tailored for smartphones. Toward practical use of Virtual Smartphone, we enhance overall system architecture. To study the issues, we conduct an internal trial in NTT laboratories. And then, we find some important specific issues in addition to usability, reliability, and economic efficiency. These specific issues include i) multi-instance associations with an end-user, ii) isolation among virtual instances and iii) changing the screen resolution dynamically. Issues i), ii) and iii) derive from virtual Android-x86 instances at the server side. We solve the above issues by overall enhancement of system architecture. Specifically, we add several functions to system architecture: 1) access controls between an end-user and plural virtual instances, 2) leveraging cloud computing platform, 3) on-demand grub menu edit, 4) monitoring traffics for each instances and 5) aggregation among application information for each end-user's instance. Function 1) solves the issue i). For the economic efficiency, we need to reduce the operational cost. Then, we leverages cloud computing platform such as OpenStack (function 2)) since it automates network configuration, etc. This also solves the issue ii). Function 3) helps to change the screen resolution dynamically. Preventing attack from virtual instances to outside, we construct the monitoring function such as IDS/IPS (function 4)).

Most recent researches on dialogue system were focusing on superficial feature of utterance aiming to the application for question-answering system, thus, they rarely considered internal emotional state and stimulus from external world. In this paper, we focused on the dialogue sentences in a drama script. By making various annotations that were considered useful to analyze the course of dialogue and the relationships among the characters, we constructed a scenario emotion corpus. We studied how the emotion of a character changes responding to the other character's utterances or emotions by analyzing this corpus.

One key aspect of the MARS concept is the low individual intelligence, meaning that each robot is equipped with only a minimum of sensor technology in order to achieve a low cost and energy efficient system that provides scalability and reliability for field tasks. The robot swarms are coordinated by a centralized entity (OptiVisor) which is responsible for path planning, optimization and supervision. It also serves as a mediator between the robots and different cloud services responsible for the documentation of the procedure. This paper focuses on the architecture and function of OptiVisor within the overall MARS system.

Lifelong Augmentation of Multimodal Streaming Autobiographical Memories,M. Petit; T. Fischer; Y. Demiris,"Personal Robotics Lab, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, UK",IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,20160908,2016,8,3,201,213,"Robot systems that interact with humans over extended periods of time will benefit from storing and recalling large amounts of accumulated sensorimotor and interaction data. We provide a principled framework for the cumulative organization of streaming autobiographical data so that data can be continuously processed and augmented as the processing and reasoning abilities of the agent develop and further interactions with humans take place. As an example, we show how a kinematic structure learning algorithm reasons a-posteriori about the skeleton of a human hand. A partner can be asked to provide feedback about the augmented memories, which can in turn be supplied to the reasoning processes in order to adapt their parameters. We employ active, multimodal remembering, so the robot as well as humans can gain insights of both the original and augmented memories. Our framework is capable of storing discrete and continuous data in real-time. The data can cover multiple modalities and several layers of abstraction (e.g., from raw sound signals over sentences to extracted meanings). We show a typical interaction with a human partner using an iCub humanoid robot. The framework is implemented in a platform-independent manner. In particular, we validate its multi platform capabilities using the iCub, Baxter and NAO robots. We also provide an interface to cloud based services, which allow automatic annotation of episodes.

Minimizing Context Migration in Mobile Code Offload,Y. Li; W. Gao,"Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee at Knoxville, 1520 Middle Drive, Knoxville, TN",IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing,20170303,2017,16,4,1005,1018,"Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is of particular importance to address the conflict between the increasing complexity of user applications and the limited lifespan of mobile device's battery, by offloading the computational workloads from local devices to the remote cloud. Current offloading schemes either require the programmer's annotations, which restricts its wide application; or transmits too much unnecessary data, resulting bandwidth, and energy waste. In this paper, we propose a novel method-level offloading methodology to offload local computational workload with as least data transmission as possible. Our basic idea is to identify the contexts which are necessary to the method execution by parsing application binaries in advance and applying this parsing result to selectively migrate heap data while allowing successful method execution remotely. To further improve the efficiency of such offline parsing of application binaries, our scheme also conducts one-time parsing to all the mobile OS libraries and reuses these parsing results for different user applications. We have implemented our design over the Dalvik Virtual Machine of Android OS. Our experiments and evaluation against applications downloaded from Google Play show that our approach can save data transmission significantly comparing to existing schemes.",1536-1233;15361233,,10.1109/TMC.2016.2586056,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7501894,Mobile cloud computing;code offload;context migration;distributed shared memory;virtual machine,Androids;Cloud computing;Context;Humanoid robots;Mobile applications;Mobile communication;Mobile handsets,Android (operating system);cloud computing;mobile computing;program compilers,Android OS;Dalvik virtual machine;context migration;method-level offloading methodology;mobile OS libraries;mobile cloud computing;mobile code offload;one-time parsing,,,,,,20160629,April 1 2017,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

It is possible to realize a real-time disaster management cloud where applications in cloud will respond within a specified time frame. If a Real-Time Cloud (RTC) is available then for intelligent machines like robots the complex processing may be done on RTC via request and response model. The complex processing is more desirable as level of intelligence increases in robots towards humans even more. Therefore, it may be possible to manage disaster sites more efficiently with more intelligent cloud robots without great lose of human lives waiting for various assistance at disaster site.

Registration with the Point Cloud Library: A Modular Framework for Aligning in 3-D,D. Holz; A. E. Ichim; F. Tombari; R. B. Rusu; S. Behnke,"University of Bonn, Bonn, 53113, Germany",IEEE Robotics & Automation Magazine,20151208,2015,22,4,110,124,"Registration is an important step when processing three-dimensional (3-D) point clouds. Applications for registration range from object modeling and tracking, to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). This article presents the open-source point cloud library (PCL) and the tools available for point cloud registration. The PCL incorporates methods for the initial alignment of point clouds using a variety of local shape feature descriptors, as well as methods for refining initial alignments using different variants of the well-known iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. This article provides an overview on registration algorithms, usage examples of their PCL implementations, and tips for their application. Since the choice and parameterization of the right algorithm for a particular type of data is one of the biggest problems in 3-D point cloud registration, we present three complete examples of data (and applications) and the respective registration pipeline in the PCL. These examples include dense red-green-blue-depth (RGB-D) point clouds acquired by consumer color and depth cameras, high-resolution laser scans from commercial 3-D scanners, and low-resolution sparse point clouds captured by a custom lightweight 3-D scanner on a microaerial vehicle (MAV).",1070-9932;10709932,,10.1109/MRA.2015.2432331,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7271006,,Cloud computing;Iterative closest point algorithm;Iterative methods;Open source software;Robot sensing systems;Sensors;Three-dimensional displays,computer graphics;feature extraction;image registration;iterative methods;shape recognition,3D alignment;3D point cloud registration;3D scanners;ICP algorithm;MAV;PCL;RGB-D point clouds;SLAM;color cameras;dense red-green-blue-depth point clouds;depth cameras;high-resolution laser scans;iterative closest point algorithm;local shape feature descriptors;low-resolution sparse point clouds;microaerial vehicle;object modeling;object tracking;open-source point cloud library;point clouds alignment;simultaneous localization and mapping,,7,,30,,20150917,Dec. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Here, we introduce an approach based on recognizing a pattern generated by laser pointers on the wall, which is captured by an infrared camera. The image of this pattern is used to locate the position of a robot in the room. The problem of working under black ceiling has been overcomed because the projection is on the wall and is moving which also increases the range of operation.

It is argued that SDI will be a first concrete impact of the Softwarization trend which is starting to impact (with different expressions, e.g., SDN, NFV, Cloud and Network Computing) the Telecommunications and ICT ecosystems.In this respect, the paper proposes the model of the Universal Operating System (UOS) for SDIs as an overarching and distributed Operating System spanning from terminals through the network elements, to the Cloud/IT resources. Then UOS functional architectures and some key challenges related to its development are briefly examined.Eventually, it is argued that this evolution towards SDI will definitely blur, on one side the border between the Telecommunications networks and the Cloud Computing, and, on the other side, the distinction between the Telecommunications networks and the future ""terminals"" connected to them (e.g., handsets, tablets, machines, smart things, drones, robot).

MCACC: New approach for augmenting the computing capabilities of mobile devices with Cloud Computing,M. A. Elgendy; A. Shawish; M. I. Moussa,"Computer Science, Faculty of Computer and Informatics, Benha, Egypt",2014 Science and Information Conference,20141009,2014,,,79,86,"Smartphones are becoming increasingly popular with a wide range of capabilities for the purpose of handling heavy applications like gaming, video editing, and face recognition etc. These kinds of applications continuously require intensive computational power, memory, and battery. Many of the early techniques solve this problem by offloading these applications to run on the Cloud due to its famous resources availability. Later, enhanced techniques choosed to offload part of the applications while leaving the rest to be processed on the smartphone based on one or two metrics like power and CPU consumption without any consideration to the communication and network overhead. With the notable development of the smartphone's hardware, it becomes crucial to develop a smarter offloading framework that is able to efficiently utilize the available smartphone's resources and only offload when necessary based on real-time decision metrics. This paper proposed such framework, which we called Mobile Capabilities Augmentation using Cloud Computing (MCACC). In this framework, any mobile application is divided into a group of services, and then each of them is either executed locally on the mobile or remotely on the Cloud based a novel dynamic offloading decision model. Here, the decision is based on five realtime metrics: total execution time, energy consumption, remaining battery, memory and security. The extensive simulation studies show that both heavy and light applications can benefit from our proposed model while saving energy and improving performance compare to previous techniques.

Privacy-preserving Grasp Planning in the Cloud,J. Mahler; B. Hou; S. Niyaz; F. T. Pokorny; R. Chandra; K. Goldberg,"AUTOLAB, University of California, Berkeley, USA",2016 IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE),20161117,2016,,,468,475,"To support industrial automation, systems such as GraspIt! and Dex-Net 1.0 provide â€œGrasp Planning as a Serviceâ€ù (GPaaS). To assist manufacturers setting up automated assembly lines, users can send part geometry via the Internet to the service and receive a ranked set of robust grasp configurations. As industrial users may be reluctant to share proprietary details of product geometry with outside parties, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach awhere a masked version of the part boundary is uploaded, allowing proprietary aspects of the part geometry to remain confidential. One challenge is the tradeoff between grasp coverage and privacy: balancing the desire for a rich set of alternative grasps based on analysis of graspable surfaces (coverage) against the desire for privacy. We introduce a grasp coverage metric based on dispersion from motion planning, and plot its relationship with privacy (the fraction of the object surface that is masked). We implement the algorithm using Dex-Net 1.0 and present case studies of the privacy-coverage tradeoff on a set of 23 industrial parts. Results suggest that masking the part using the convex hull of the proprietary zone can provide grasp coverage with minor distortion to the object similarity metric used to accelerate grasp planning in Dex-Net 1.0.

Dynamic Android Malware Classification Using Graph-Based Representations,L. Xu; D. Zhang; M. A. Alvarez; J. A. Morales; X. Ma; J. Cavazos,,2016 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cyber Security and Cloud Computing (CSCloud),20160818,2016,,,220,231,"Malware classification for the Android ecosystem can be performed using a range of techniques. One major technique that has been gaining ground recently is dynamic analysis based on system call invocations recorded during the executions of Android applications. Dynamic analysis has traditionally been based on converting system calls into flat feature vectors and feeding the vectors into machine learning algorithms for classification. In this paper, we implement three traditional feature-vector-based representations for Android system calls. For each feature vector representation, we also propose a novel graph-based representation. We then use graph kernels to compute pair-wise similarities and feed these similarity measures into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. To speed up the graph kernel computation, we compress the graphs using the Compressed Row Storage format, and then we apply OpenMP to parallelize the computation. Experiments show that the graph-based representations are able to improve the classification accuracy over the corresponding feature-vector-based representations from the same input.

Respawn: A Distributed Multi-resolution Time-Series Datastore,M. Buevich; A. Wright; R. Sargent; A. Rowe,"Dept. of Electr. & Comput. Eng., Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA",2013 IEEE 34th Real-Time Systems Symposium,20140130,2013,,,288,297,"As sensor networks gain traction and begin to scale, we will be increasingly faced with challenges associated with managing large-scale time-series data. In this paper, we present a cloud-to-edge partitioned architecture called Respawn that is capable of serving large amounts of time-series data from a continuously updating datastore with access latencies low enough to support interactive real-time visualization. Respawn targets sensing systems where resource-constrained edge node devices may only have limited or intermittent network connections linking them to a cloud-backend. The cloud-backend provides aggregate storage and transparent dispatching of data queries to edge node devices. Data is downsampled as it enters the system creating a multi-resolution representation capable of lowlatency range-base queries. Lower-resolution aggregate data is automatically migrated from edge nodes to the cloud-backend both for improved consistency and caching. In order to further mask latency from users, edge nodes automatically identify and migrate blocks of data that contain statistically interesting features. We show through simulation and micro-benchmarking that Respawn is able to run on ARM-based edge node devices connected to a cloud-backend with the ability to serve thousands of clients and terabytes of data with sub-second latencies.",1052-8725;10528725,Electronic:978-1-4799-2006-8; POD:978-1-4799-4898-7,10.1109/RTSS.2013.36,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6728883,,Aggregates;Databases;Logic gates;Sensors;Standards;Tiles;Time series analysis,cache storage;cloud computing;data visualisation;interactive systems;query processing;time series,ARM-based edge node devices;Respawn;cloud-backend;cloud-to-edge partitioned architecture;data queries;distributed multiresolution time-series datastore;interactive real-time visualization;lower-resolution aggregate data;multiresolution representation;resource-constrained edge node devices,,1,,22,,,3-6 Dec. 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Beyond the conventional map which represents the existence of wall and objects, Human Motion Map represents not only the existence of humans in a particular location but also motion distributions. With recent improvements of the cloud computing technology, Human Motion Map can be accumulated as a kind of big data while measurements of robots are performed continuingly while it is moving around.

It offers a dynamic and efficient remote access to information services and resources for mobile devices. Mobile Cloud computing has been evolved as a distributed service model, where individual mobile users are Cloud service providers. Compared to traditional Internet-centric Cloud service models, the complexity of mobile service management in a dynamic and distributed service environment is increased dramatically. To address this challenge, we propose to establish an OSGi-based mobile Cloud service model â€” MCC-OSGi â€” that uses OSGi Bundles as the basic mobile Cloud service building components. The proposed solution supports OSGi bundles running on both mobile devices and Cloud-side virtual machine OS platforms, and the bundles can be transferred and run on different platforms without compatibility issues. The presented solution is achieved: 1) by incorporating OSGi into Android software development platform, 2) by setting up a Remote-OSGi on the Cloud and on mobile devices, and 3) by defining three service architecture models.

To face the limitations of the computational capabilities of robot on-board control computer, it is required to split the control systems between the robot embedded and the cloud computational resources.

The embedded computer hosts a core agent, which provides the task-independent robot capabilities. The task dependent part called the dynamic agent is loaded from the cloud when required. The two mentioned agents execute the task, additionally utilising the capabilities of the cloud. Once the task is finished the dynamic agent is destroyed and the core agent awaits new user demands, upon which it reacts by downloading a new dynamic agent.

A management proxy in a cloud, for example, needs ability to monitor change in the most popular webpages associated with a website or files associated with an application so that this detail may influence the caching strategy for optimised performance and operation. When resources are provisioned dynamically across a cloud, the strategy to do so will accommodate efficiency and security objectives, and also take into account the ways in which users are demanding services to optimise the opportunities that their requirements are met. Many online companies now operate in this way and analyse customer behaviour to improve services by meeting predictable requirements and utilising unpredictable behaviour. It is therefore to this gap we respond in this work. A network management model is developed around behaviour profiles of user activities associated with the Wireless Sensor Knowledge Archive (Wisekar) website hosted in the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, India. Trends in user access and activities with the website are identified and, in response, a management framework is proposed.

Robot-Audition-based Human-Machine Interface for a Car,K. Nakadai; T. Mizumoto; K.

A RA-CHMI, like a car navigation system, has difficulty dealing with voice commands, since there are many noise sources in a car, including road noise, air-conditioner, music, and passengers. Microphone array processing developed in robot audition, may overcome this problem. Robot audition techniques, including sound source localization, Voice Activity Detection (VAD), sound source separation, and barge-in-able processing, were introduced by considering the characteristics of RA-CHMI. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), based on a Deep Neural Network (DNN), improved recognition performance and robustness in a noisy environment. In addition, as an integrated framework, HARK-Dialog was developed to build a multi-party and multi-modal dialog system, enabling the seamless use of cloud and local services with pluggable modular architecture. The constructed multi-party and multimodal RA-CHMI system did not require a push-to-talk button, nor did it require reducing the audio volume or air-conditioner when issuing speech commands. It could also control a four-DOF robot agent to make the system's responses more understandable. The proposed RA-CHMI was validated by evaluating essential techniques in the system, such as VAD and DNN-ASR, using real speech data recorded during driving. The entire design of the RA-CHMI system, including the system response time and the proper use of cloud/local services, are also discussed.",,Electronic:978-1-4799-9994-1; POD:978-1-4799-9995-8; USB:978-1-4799-9993-4,10.1109/IROS.2015.7354250,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7354250,,Arrays;Microphones;Roads;Robots;Speech;Speech recognition;Vehicles,automobiles;cloud computing;driver information systems;human-robot interaction;interactive systems;mobile robots;neural nets;speech recognition,ASR;DNN-ASR;HARK- Dialog;RA-CHMI;VAD;automatic speech recognition;barge-in-able processing;car navigation system;cloud services;deep-neural network;four-DOF robot agent;integrated framework;local services;microphone array processing;multiparty-multimodal dialog system;noisy environment;pluggable modular architecture;real speech data;recognition performance improvement;robot-audition-based car human-machine interface;robustness improvement;sound source localization;sound source separation;system responses;voice activity detection,,,,20,,,Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Smartphones have been used as a cost-effective method to sense and monitor mobile cellular networks, e.g., network coverage, mobile traffics, and Quality-of-Experience of subscribers. In this paper, we propose a crowdsourcing platform for sensing and monitoring cellular networks based on the spatial and temporal data from smartphones, which includes an Android-app and Cloud-based data-mining system. Different from previous such systems which only consider the outdoor macro-cellular area, in our platform the monitoring of the indoor area is also incorporated. To accurately record the locations of the mobile devices in indoor area, beacon devices are deployed in the ceiling antennas to guide the location computing of mobile smartphones via BLE module, which is more energy-efficient than WIFI. Through our proposed platform a large-scale yet fine-grained spatial-temporal measurements are recorded and analyzed. We show that through this platform a detailed and quick responded sensing and monitoring of the whole cellular networks can be practical, especially in the indoor areas.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-0214-6; POD:978-1-5090-0215-3,10.1109/DSDIS.2015.37,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396543,crowdsourcing;indoor network monitoring;smartphone,Androids;Conferences;Humanoid robots;Servers,Android (operating system);Internet;cellular radio;cloud computing;data mining;green computing;indoor radio;smart phones,Android app;cellular network monitoring;cellular network sensing;cloud-based data-mining system;cost-effective method;crowdsourcing platform;green communication network;indoor network;mobile Internet;mobile smartphone device,,2,,3,,,11-13 Dec. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

However, as the memory-size of supercomputers continues to grow geometrically, the cost of tape bandwidth is becoming more important. The projected costs for tape-drives, robotics, and maintenance, are creating challenges for tape-based archives. The advent of erasure-coded object storage, driven by the ""cloud storage"" industry, might make it practical to implement archives using disks, or hybrid disk-and-tape systems. We used linear optimization techniques to investigate when and how this transition might best be made, taking into consideration our significant investment in tape technology.

The biggest challenge comes from the non-holonomic characteristics of automobiles and short-distance obstacles. The algorithm in question solves the obstacles avoidance by using Minkowski sum. Geometric path planning is derived from kinematics and connected with path parameters of Runge-Kutta discretization method. Since parking paths and relevant parameters can be obtained by virtue of Runge-Kutta discretization method, the optimization method for every discrete path is to calculate parking paths that are independent from parking lots. The static optimization method can be resolved by digitization in an effective way. Effects of the above mentioned algorithm will be evaluated by different stimulation scenarios. The stimulation experiments show that path planning algorithm regarding rapid parking based on static optimization is feasible for the following three parking scenarios-parallel parking, vertical parking and angle parking. All these three parking forms can be achieved on the premise of no modification in algorithm.

Therefore, GCM is not suitable for time sensitive and/or ""must-deliver-to-all"" app scenarios. On the other hand, GCM delivers the push messages to a big portion of the subscribers (more than 40% in any experiment scenario) in a reasonable timeframe (in 10 seconds).

Microsoft VPL is service-oriented, uses workflow-based visual programming, and has strong support for parallel computing. It is a milestone and flagship in software engineering and in computer science education. Many universities and high schools have adopted VPL as a tool for teaching computing and engineering concepts and for programming robots. Unfortunately, as part of Microsoft's restructuring plan, the robotics division of Microsoft Research was suspended on September 22, 2014, leaving the Microsoft VPL community without updates and support. Arizona State University (ASU) is among the schools that adopted VPL since its first release in 2006. We started to find a solution to our VPL-based curriculum in 2014. This paper presents our research and development of a new visual programming language and its development environment: ASU VIPLE (Visual IoT/Robotics Programming Language Environment). ASU VIPLE extends the discontinued Microsoft VPL to sustain our curriculum and to help the community with their VPL projects. ASU VIPLE supports LEGO EV3 and all IoT devices based on an open architecture. ASU VIPLE integrates engineering design process, workflow, fundamental programming concepts, control flow, parallel computing, event-driven programming seamlessly into the curriculum.

There are many advantages to use prepaid meter as opposed to postpaid meter both to the utility provider and to the consumer. Brunei Darussalam has adopted PM but it is not intelligent and not wireless enabled. Reading meters and topping up balance are still done manually. Utility provider does not have information on the usage statistics and has only limited functionalities in the grid control. So accordingly a novel software agent based wireless prepaid energy meter was developed using Java Agent Development Environment (JADE-LEAP) allowing agent from utility provider to query wireless energy meter for energy values of every household. These statistics can be used for statistical computation of the power consumed and for policy and future planning.,,CD-ROM:978-1-4799-4765-2; Electronic:978-1-4799-4764-5; POD:978-1-4799-4763-8,10.1109/CCIOT.2014.7062509,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062509,JADE;LEAP;Prepaid Meter;Wireless Prepaid Smart Meter,Androids;Communication system security;Databases;Humanoid robots;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Zigbee,Java;power engineering computing;power meters;software agents;statistical analysis,JADE-LEAP;Java agent development environment;prepaid wireless energy meter;smart agent;software agent;statistical computation,,1,,18,,,13-14 Dec. 2014,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

The benefits of this model are plenty, including the ability to rapidly and effectively acquire, introduce, maintain, and enhance software used by the consumers. This paradigm shift, however, has given rise to a new set of security challenges. In parallel with the emergence of app markets, we have witnessed increased security threats that are exploiting this model of provisioning software. The key obstacle is the ability to rapidly assess the security and robustness of applications submitted to the market. The problem is that security testing is generally a manual, expensive, and cumbersome process. This is precisely the challenge that we have begun to address in a project targeted at the development of a framework that aids the analysts in testing the security of Android apps.

Rubber ball to cloud rehabilitation musing on the future of therapy,G. C. Burdea,"Rutgers Tele-Rehabilitation Institute, CAIP Center, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA",2009 Virtual Rehabilitation International Conference,20090724,2009,,,50,50,"We can trace the origins of virtual rehabilitation to the late 80s when sensing gloves were used to determine the degree of hand tremor in patients with Parkinson, and virtual environments were investigated as a medium to train wheelchair navigation. At the first Medicine Meets Virtual Reality conference in San Diego in 1992, we proposed a unified system where sensing gloves were used to diagnose and train patients post hand surgery. Other researchers pioneered the use of virtual environments in phobias, attention deficit, post-traumatic stress and other conditions. In 1996 researchers interested primarily in VR phobia treatment started the CyberTherapy conference series, and VR-based physical therapy, occupational therapy, therapy for learning deficits, and amnesia were reported at the first International Conference on Disability, Virtual Reality and Associated Technologies. By 1997 the National Science Foundation funded a study of rehabilitation at a distance between Rutgers and Stanford universities, located on either side of the United States. These beginnings used color-coded virtual rubber balls and haptic gloves to program the mechanical work done by the patient's affected hand. An artificial separation existed in the clinical practice between physical or occupational rehabilitation and cognitive therapy, due in part to separate education tracks. Nonetheless virtual reality researchers realized that the same hardware could be used in either physical or cognitive rehabilitation, and all that needed changing was the simulation software used. We thus coined the term â€œvirtual rehabilitationâ€ù to encompass the continuum of therapy. In 2002 the associated conference started in Switzerland as the International Workshop on Virtual Rehabilitation. This later became the Virtual Rehabilitation International Conference series which you are attending today. While â€œvirtual rehabilitationâ€ù was initially met with some skepticism by therapists - who were concerned patients will misunderstand it, nowadays the term is better understood. To help further recognition for this emerging field, a new society was formed in 2008, the International Society for Virtual Rehabilitation (www.isvr.org), which is a co-sponsor of this conference. The merging of physical/occupational therapy and cognitive therapy is not due solely to the modularity offered by the hardware and software used in virtual environments. Another cause is the fact that patients affected by certain neurologic and motor deficits often have psychological and other cognitive co-morbidities. A well known example is depression associated with some types of stroke or with societal isolation that often follows the inability to have regular employment. The same tele-rehabilitation systems that are projected for large scale use to train patients in their home, may also be used to reduce the sense of isolation. Video games that are now being investigated as a way to reinvigorate therapeutic interventions could also be used in future game â€œtournamentsâ€ù among teams of people with disabilities, or among people with disabilities and their families and friends. Virtual environments could then be used to customize the games and allow a patient to succeed, greatly boosting morale. An extreme example is the use of virtual hand avatars controlled by people with amputated arms, an application which we pioneered back in 2003. Popular awareness of and demand for virtual rehabilitation is expected to grow, which in turn will trigger changes in the way therapists are educated and accredited. A new field of study will emerge, as will the way therapists and psychologists will be recertified. Certainly the way licensing, insurance, even liability clauses follow local geography is archaic, and a more global certification program is expected to emerge. The one-to-one paradigm of therapy will also change, with one therapist performing â€œmultiplexedâ€ù",2331-9542;23319542,POD:978-1-4244-4188-4,10.1109/ICVR.2009.5174204,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5174204,,Clouds;Games;Hardware;Medical treatment;Navigation;Psychology;Rubber;Virtual environment;Virtual reality;Wheelchairs,computer games;handicapped aids;patient rehabilitation;virtual reality,Web servers;amnesia;amputated arms;attention deficit disorder;certification program;cloud computing;cloud rehabilitation;cognitive co-morbidities;cognitive therapy;color-coded virtual rubber balls;depression;disability-specific software simulations;distributed databases;force multipliers;hand surgery;haptic gloves;home-based patient training;home-based robots;medical data portability;motor deficits;neurologic deficits;occupational therapy;phobias;portable communication terminals;portable computing terminals;post-traumatic stress;psychological co-morbidities;sensing gloves;societal isolation;software licensing;software maintenance;stroke;tele-rehabilitation systems;therapeutic interventions;video games;virtual environments;virtual hand avatars;virtual rehabilitation;wheelchair navigation,,3,,,,,June 29 2009-July 2 2009,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

An edge operating system enabling anything-as -a-service,A. Manzalini; N. Crespi,"Telecom Italia, Strategy and Innovation - Future Centre",IEEE Communications Magazine,20160317,2016,54,3,62,67,"This article argues that SDN and NFV, together with cloud and edge-fog computing, can be seen as different facets of a systemic transformation of telecommunications and ICT, called softwarization. The first impact will be at the edge of current telecommunications infrastructures, which are becoming powerful network and service platforms. The edge operating system (EOS) software architecture is proposed as the means to get there. In fact, the main feature of EOS is to bring several service domains, such as cloud robotics, Internet of Things, and Tactile Internet, into convergence at the edge. The development of EOS leverages available open source software.

Feasibility of connecting machinery and robots to industrial control services in the cloud,C. Horn; J.

The modularization and dissolution of the â€œautomation pyramidâ€ù leads from a hierarchical information and communication structure towards a highly cross-linked structure. The classic separation of the field level to cell and management level up to the factory level will become obsolete. The limiting factor for an extensive implementation of cloud platforms in production environments is located in missing standard interfaces between machinery, robots, production systems and the novel cloud infrastructures and services. Especially machinery without Ethernet-based communication interfaces cannot be integrated. To fill this gap we introduce our concept and three different connection scenarios for a connector layer in the use-case industrial control-as-a-service for cloud manufacturing. The scenarios include the utilization of Programmable Logic Controllers and micro-controllers as connector technologies as well as direct machine to cloud connection. We evaluate each scenario with a realistic experimental setup and present the results of our experiments.",,,10.1109/ETFA.2016.7733661,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7733661,,Automation;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Connectors;Machinery;Manufacturing,cloud computing;computer integrated manufacturing,automation pyramid;cloud manufacturing;factory level;field level;industrial control services;management level;micro-controllers;novel cloud infrastructures;programmable logic controllers,,,,,,,6-9 Sept. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In order to increase the autonomy of CPS they must be connected to rich cloud services (e.g., social software and elastic resource services) enabling more sophisticated decision making. Traditionally, software agents are used in these systems to automate computational tasks by separating decision making from routine execution and hence letting the systems act autonomously.

However, improper size of VM pool and unbalanced loads on devices can result in low resource utilization or increase the response time of tests. To manage the resources of CTP more effectively, this paper presents a resource adaptation strategy that can adjust the number of VMs dynamically based on the workload of CTP and the number of available devices and can balance the loads across multiple devices of the same type to improve their usages and the average waiting time of tests.

On the other hand the cloud infrastructure enables multiple laboratories to come together virtually to create an ecosystem for educators and learners. From such a system, educators can pick and mix materials to create suitable courses for their students. This means that learners can experience different types of devices and laboratories through the cloud. The paper provides an overview of the CLEM project, presenting results so far.

Toward cloud-based grasping with uncertainty in shape: Estimating lower bounds on achieving force closure with zero-slip push grasps,B. Kehoe; D. Berenson; K.

We consider the most common robot gripper: a pair of thin parallel jaws, and a class of objects that can be modeled as extruded polygons. We model a conservative class of push-grasps that can enhance object alignment. The grasp planning algorithm takes as input an approximate object outline and Gaussian uncertainty around each vertex and center of mass. We define a grasp quality metric based on a lower bound on the probability of achieving force closure. We present a highly-parallelizable algorithm to compute this metric using Monte Carlo sampling. The algorithm uses Coulomb frictional grasp mechanics and a fast geometric test for conservative conditions for force closure. We run the algorithm on a set of sample shapes and compare the grasps with those from a planner that does not model shape uncertainty. We report computation times with single and multi-core computers and sensitivity analysis on algorithm parameters.

In practice, this is far from truth and instead, there has been evidence that security is not one of the primary design tenets for the mobile app stores. Recent studies have indicated mobile markets are harboring apps that are either malicious or vulnerable leading to compromises of millions of devices. The key technical obstacle for the organizations overseeing these markets is the lack of practical and automated mechanisms to assess the security of mobile apps, given that thousands of apps are added and updated on a daily basis. In this paper, we provide an overview of a multi-faceted project targeted at automatically testing the security and robustness of Android apps in a scalable manner.

Utilization of textured stereovision for registration of 3D models of objects,T. Kornuta; M.

A typical visual perception subsystem relies on finding the correspondences between features extracted from RGB-D images retrieved from robot sensors and models of objects. In this paper we introduce a multi-camera setup supplemented with an additional pattern projector used for registration of high-resolution images of objects. The objects are placed on a fiducial board with two dot patterns enabling robust extraction of masks of the placed objects and estimation of their initial poses. The acquired dense point clouds constituting subsequent object views undergo pairwise registration and at the end are optimized with a graph-based technique derived from SLAM. The combination of all those elements resulted in a system for generation of consistent 3D models of objects. We present details of the developed system and conclude the paper with discussion of the achieved results.,,,10.1109/MMAR.2016.7575289,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7575289,,Cameras;Cloud computing;Estimation;Feature extraction;Sensors;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays,SLAM (robots);feature extraction;graph theory;image colour analysis;image registration;image resolution;image sensors;image texture;robot vision;stereo image processing,3D model registration;RGB-D sensors;SLAM;dense point clouds;dot patterns;extracted features;fiducial board;graph-based technique;high-resolution images;multicamera setup;pattern projector;robot visual perception;textured stereovision,,,,,,,Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 1 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications
A fast approach to enable mobile apps with Geo-Location logging and reporting,Yanke Hu; Xiwang Zhang; Liangmin Hu,"IBM, San Francisco, California 94105, US",2015 23rd International Conference on Geoinformatics,20160114,2015,,,1,4,"With the rapid evolvement of mobile and cloud technology, the cost of collecting and studying human behavior data is largely reduced. Geo-location data is probably the most important and interesting data that vendors and researchers care about when their designed apps are being used. If an organization maintains several apps, and it wants to monitor the geo-location trend of each app's usage, it will be chaotic and redundant to implement geo-location logging module for every individual app. Instead, it's much cleaner to encapsulate geo-location logging component into SDKs, and centralize the reporting portals into the same cloud service. In this paper, we propose an approach of Modularization SDK Implementation and Cloud reporting architecture, to enable Mobile apps with sensor information logging and reporting by inserting one single line of code.

Rapyuta: A Cloud Robotics Platform,G. Mohanarajah; D. Hunziker; R. D'Andrea; M. Waibel,"Institute of Dynamic Systems and Control (IDSC), ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,20150403,2015,12,2,481,493,"In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Rapyuta, an open-source cloud robotics platform. Rapyuta helps robots to offload heavy computation by providing secured customizable computing environments in the cloud. The computing environments also allow the robots to easily access the RoboEarth knowledge repository. Furthermore, these computing environments are tightly interconnected, paving the way for deployment of robotic teams. We also describe three typical use cases, some benchmarking and performance results, and two proof-of-concept demonstrations. Note to Practitioners - Rapyuta allows to outsource some or all of a robot's onboard computational processes to a commercial data center. Its main difference to other, similar frameworks like the Google App Engine is that it is specifically tailored towards multiprocess high-bandwidth robotics applications/middlewares and provides a well-documented open-source implementation that can be modified to cover a large variety of robotic scenarios. Rapyuta supports the outsourcing of almost all of the current 3000+ ROS packages out of the box and is easily extensible to other robotic middleware. A pre-installed Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is provided that allows to launch Rapyuta in any of Amazon's data center within minutes. Once launched, robots can authenticate themselves to Rapyuta, create one or more secured computational environments in the cloud and launch the desired nodes/processes. The computing environments can also be arbitrarily connected to build parallel computing architectures on the fly. The WebSocket-based communication protocol, which provides synchronous and asynchronous communication mechanisms, allows not only ROS based robots, but also browsers and mobiles phones to connect to the ecosystem. Rapyuta's computing environments are private, secure, and optimized for data throughput. However, its performance is in large part determined by the latency and quality of the network connection - nd the performance of the data center. Optimizing performance under these constraints is typically highly application-specific. The paper illustrates an example of performance optimization in a collaborative real-time 3-D mapping application. Other target applications include collaborative 3-D mapping, task/grasp planning, object recognition, localization, and teleoperation, among others.",1545-5955;15455955,,10.1109/TASE.2014.2329556,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6853392,Cloud robotics;cloud-based mapping;networked robots;platform-as-a-service (PaaS),Cloud computing;Containers;Data structures;Open source software;Protocols;Robots,cloud computing;middleware;parallel processing;programming environments;public domain software;robot programming;software packages,AMI;Amazon Machine Image;Amazon data center;Google App Engine;ROS based robots;ROS packages outsourcing;Rapyuta;RoboEarth knowledge repository;WebSocket-based communication protocol;asynchronous communication mechanisms;benchmarking;browsers;collaborative real-time 3D mapping application;commercial data center;data throughput;ecosystem;mobiles phones;multiprocess high-bandwidth robotics;network connection latency;network connection quality;object recognition;open-source cloud robotics platform;parallel computing architectures;performance optimization;proof-of-concept demonstrations;robot onboard computational processes;robotic middleware;robotic teams deployment;secured customizable computing environments;task/grasp planning;use cases,,20,,37,,20140711,Apr-15,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

In this article, we propose a malware detection framework to protect the mobile devices with the help of the cloud, where the cloud is equipped with the facilities for automatic analysis of large amount of new malware generated everyday, and the device is able to detect malicious intents of running software in real-time based on the knowledge of the analyzed malware. We evaluate the performance of our framework with Android-based systems as case studies. In particular, we study the impact of different system configurations on the time required for malware detection, including detecting algorithms (i.e., CNN and SVM), mobile processors (i.e., ARM CPU and NVIDIA GPU), and wireless networks (i.e., Wi-Fi and 3G for the communication between the device and the cloud). To the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any other work studying performance impacts of the system configurations of the malware detection systems using the physical machines.

BBCast: Intuitive design and utility of a cloud based bulletin board,M. L. Ting; J. F. Palngipang; R. Atienza,"Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute, University of the Philippines-Diliman, Philippines",2016 IEEE Region 10 Conference (TENCON),20170209,2016,,,354,357,"As digital displays become more ubiquitous, we find ways to make them cheaper, lighter, more interactive and easy to use and deploy. Our past project BBCast, aimed to achieve these by utilizing the cloud as a repository using Chromecast and creating a controller application in the widespread platform Android. However, the project failed to fully address the problem plaguing most technology which is poor design. Most of technologies are designed by engineers with little to no regard for user experience and product design usually focusing only on functionality. Interactive pervasive displays like other technologies, achieve their intended purpose when a lot of people use them. Bad design discourages user adoption. This paper aims to resolve this problem by redesigning the BBCast project with a proper user experience and user interface. Guidelines in designing were taken from academic papers, online resources and trends by companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft. To properly asses the design quantitatively and qualitatively, methods from the Nielsen Norman group were adopted. The system was tested for stability which is a part of usability. To further possible adoption of the technology, other uses for the system were explored in this paper.

Coordination of multi-agent systems via asynchronous cloud communication,S. L. Bowman; C. Nowzari; G. J. Pappas,"Computer and Information Science department, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States",2016 IEEE 55th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC),20161229,2016,,,2215,2220,"In this work we study a multi-agent coordination problem in which agents are only able to communicate with each other intermittently through a cloud server. To reduce the amount of required communication, we develop a self-triggered algorithm that allows agents to communicate with the cloud only when necessary rather than at some fixed period. Unlike the vast majority of similar works that propose distributed event- and/or self-triggered control laws, this work doesn't assume agents can be â€œlisteningâ€ù continuously. In other words, when an event is triggered by one agent, neighboring agents will not be aware of this until the next time they establish communication with the cloud themselves. Using a notion of â€œpromisesâ€ù about future control inputs, agents are able to keep track of higher quality estimates about their neighbors allowing them to stay disconnected from the cloud for longer periods of time while still guaranteeing a positive contribution to the task. We show that our self-triggered coordination algorithm guarantees that the system asymptotically reaches the desired state.

A spiking neural network (SNN) is used to model the neuromodulatory function for generating context based behavioral responses of the robots to sensory input signals. The neural network incorporates three types of neurons- cholinergic and noradrenergic (ACh/NE) neurons for attention focusing and action selection, dopaminergic (DA) neurons for rewards- and curiosity-seeking, and serotonergic (5-HT) neurons for risk aversion behaviors. The model depicts description of neuron activity that is biologically realistic but computationally efficient to allow for large-scale simulation of thousands of neurons. The model is implemented using graphics processing units (GPUs) for parallel computing in real-time using the ROS environment. The model is implemented to study the risk-taking, risk-aversive, and distracted behaviors of the neuromodulated robots in single- and multi-robot configurations. The entire process is implemented in a distributed computing framework using ROS where the robots communicate wirelessly with the computing nodes through the on-board laptops.

Therefore, we collaboratively analyzed the social data and used it to develop an android mobile application called Get Tweet Information (GTI) to extract tweets from the Twitter using Twitter API. This application initially asks the user for the search keyword and then it analyse the whole Twitter database to find all the tweets that contains input keyword.

Toward QoS-Aware Cloud Robotic Applications: A Hybrid Architecture and Its Implementation,Y. Li; H. Wang; B. Ding; P. Shi; X. Liu,"Coll. of Comput., Nat.

Due to the limitations of its local resources, the capability of a single robot is usually severely restricted. Cloud robotics has been recently proposed to extend the capability of robots by leveraging the rich services provided in cloud. However, robotic applications generally give considerable attention to quality of service (QoS) because these applications interact directly with the physical world. Fulfilling strict QoS requirements while utilizing cloud services, the performance of which is highly unpredictable, is a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture for cloud robotics, named RoboCloud, to address this challenge. Instead of simply integrating robots with public cloud services, RoboCloud introduces a task-specified mission cloud with controllable resources, predictable behavior. The mission cloud can extend the capability of the robot on its specified, predictable tasks without sacrificing QoS. For general tasks beyond the capability of the mission cloud, we opt for public clouds, i.e., various cloud services available on the Internet. We successfully apply this architecture to realize robotic object recognition, which is a fundamental capability of autonomous robots who interact with an open environment. We can minimize the recognition latency of objects that are predicted to appear in a specific task without sacrificing the capability to recognize unfamiliar, unexpected objects by seamlessly integrating a specialized mission cloud, a public object recognition service on the Internet.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-2771-2; POD:978-1-5090-2772-9,10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP-SmartWorld.2016.0028,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816824,cloud robotics;mission cloud;mobile cloud computing;object recognition;public cloud,Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Object recognition;Quality of service;Robot kinematics,cloud computing;control engineering computing;object recognition;quality of service;robot programming;robot vision;task analysis,Internet;QoS-aware cloud robotic applications;autonomous robots;critical tasks;hybrid architecture;public object recognition service;quality of service;specialized mission cloud,,,,,,,18-21 July 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Some of the findings require fundamental research to advance the current state of the art, while others point to overlooked factors that should be considered during robot design. The best use of currently available autonomous robots in the defence application appears to be liable, easily deployed system that increases situational awareness with minimal impact on the industrial team's workload. This implies that the robot's mobility must be predictable rather than â€œintelligentâ€ù, must be based on on-board sensing, and easily directed by commanders.

Internet based robotic systems have been gaining importance of late and we explore one such application in the field of remote surveillance. Even though direct control has potential difficulties due to unpredictable delay, recent technological advances have reduced this to a large extent. This paper describes a direct model of robot control. The system uses standard protocol and a machine-human interface. Using a Web browser (thin client), a remote user can control the mobile robot to navigate in an enclosure with visual feedback via the Internet. The use of an intuitive user interface permits Internet users to access and control the mobile robot and perform useful tasks remotely, from a different location. The direct mode is implemented with the help of event driven methods which provide complete control over the robot. This paper proposes a model architecture for direct control and discusses an implementation and performance of a networked robot system with the help of Cloud computing.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-9692-9; POD:978-1-4673-9693-6,10.1109/iNIS.2015.47,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7434427,IOT;WebRTC,Cloud computing;Instruments;Robots;Streaming media;Web servers,Internet;cloud computing;control engineering computing;mobile robots;surveillance,Internet;Internet based robotic system;Web browser;cloud computing;machine-human interface;mobile robot;remote surveillance robot system;visual feedback,,,,17,,,21-23 Dec. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Surprisingly, this potential has not been extensively exploited up to now. A reason for this is that, since the acquired depth images are noisy, most of the available registration algorithms are hardly applicable. A further difficulty is that the transformations between views are in general not accurately known, a circumstance that multi-view object modeling algorithms do not handle properly under noisy conditions. In this work, we take into account both uncertainty sources (in images and camera poses) to generate spatially consistent 3D object models fusing multiple views with a probabilistic approach. We propose a method to compute the covariance of the registration process, and apply an iterative state estimation method to build object models under noisy conditions.",1050-4729;10504729,Electronic:978-1-4244-5040-4; POD:978-1-4244-5038-1,10.1109/ROBOT.2010.5509197,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5509197,,Cameras;Cloud computing;Computer interfaces;Iterative methods;Robot vision systems;Robotics and automation;Solid modeling;Topology;USA Councils;Uncertainty,cameras;image fusion;image registration;iterative methods;probability;state estimation;uncertain systems,3D images;3D object models;ToF camera;fast object modeling algorithms;image registration algorithms;iterative state estimation method;multiple view fusion;multiview object modeling algorithms;probabilistic approach;time-of-flight camera;uncertainty reduction approach,,8,,25,,,3-7 May 2010,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

The SOUL abstractions in this paper address two issues faced by such applications: (1) access to sensors with the levels of convenience needed for their ubiquitous, dynamic use, and only by parties authorized to do so, and (2) scalability in sensor access, given today's multitude of sensors. Toward this end, SOUL, first, introduces a new abstraction for the applications to transparently and uniformly access both on-device and ambient sensors with associated actuators. Second, potentially expensive sensor-related processing needs not just occur on smartphones, but can also leverage edge-and remote-cloud resources. Finally, SOUL provides access control methods that permit users to easily define access permissions for sensors, which leverages users' social ties and captures the context in which access requests are made. SOUL demonstrates that the applications on Android platforms can scale the use of 100s of sensors with performance and energy efficiency.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3322-5; POD:978-1-5090-3323-2,10.1109/SEC.2016.9,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7774703,Android;Personal Cloud;SOUL;Sensor;access control;edge cloud;social network services,Actuators;Aggregates;Androids;Humanoid robots;Sensors;Smart phones,Internet of Things;cloud computing;mobile computing;sensors;smart phones,Android platforms;Internet of Things;SOUL;ambient sensors;edge-cloud system;mobile applications;on-device sensors;remote-cloud resources;resource-constrained devices;sensor access;sensor-related processing;sensor-rich world;smartphones,,,,,,,27-28 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

One of the most challenging tasks before collecting and processing data from these devices (e.g. sensors) is discovering and configuring the sensors and the associated data streams. In this paper, we propose a tool called SmartLink that can be used to discover and configure sensors. Specifically, SmartLink, is capable of discovering sensors deployed in a particular location despite their heterogeneity (e.g. different communication protocols, communication sequences, capabilities). SmartLink establishes the direct communication between the sensor hardware and cloud-based IoT middleware. We address the challenge of heterogeneity using a plugin architecture.

Similar to traditional cyber security, mobile security includes authentication, data integrity, and data privacy. Seed-based authentication is a novel approach for mobile systems. The key idea is to extract seeds from files such as images and generate random numbers for authentication.

On the Cost of Mining Very Large Open Source Repositories,S. Banerjee; B. Cukic,"Robot. Inst., Carnegie Mellon Univ., Pittsburgh, PA, USA",2015 IEEE/ACM 1st International Workshop on Big Data Software Engineering,20150727,2015,,,37,43,"Open source bug tracking systems provide a rich information suite that is actively used by software engineering researchers to design solutions to triaging, duplicate classification and developer assignment problems. Today, open repositories often contain in excess of 100, 000 reports, and in cases of RedHat and Mozilla, over a million. Obtaining and analyzing the contents of such datasets are both time and resource consuming. By summarizing the related work we demonstrate that researchers often focused on smaller subsets of the data, and seldom embrace the â€œbig-dataismâ€ù. With the emergence of cloud based computation systems such as Amazon EC2, one expects it to be easier to perform large scale analyses. However, our detailed time and cost analysis indicates that significant challenges still remain. Acquiring the open source data can be time intensive, and prone to being misinterpreted as Denial of Service attacks. Generating similarity scores for all prior reports, for example, is a polynomial time problem. In this paper, we present actual costs that we incurred when analyzing the complete repositories from Eclipse, Firefox and Open Office. In our approach, we relied on computing clusters to process the data in an attempt to reduce the cost of analyzing large datasets on the cloud. We present estimated costs for a researcher attempting to analyze complete datasets from Eclipse, Mozilla, Novell and RedHat using the best possible resources. In an ideal situation, with no bottlenecks, a researcher investing just over $40, 000 and 2 weeks of non stop computing time would be able to measure similarity of problem reports within all four datasets.",,Electronic:978-1-4673-7025-7; POD:978-1-4673-7026-4,10.1109/BIGDSE.2015.16,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7166057,,Accuracy;Computer crime;Data mining;Graphics processing units;Random access memory;XML,Big Data;cloud computing;computational complexity;data mining;public domain software;software engineering,Amazon EC2;Big-Dataism;Eclipse;Firefox;Novell;Open Office;RedHat;cloud based computation systems;cost analysis;data processing;denial of service attacks;open source bug tracking systems;polynomial time problem;software engineering;time analysis;very large open source repository mining,,2,,24,,,23-23 May 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Path planning as a service PPaaS: Cloud-based robotic path planning,M. L. Lam; K. Y. Lam,"School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong",2014 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Biomimetics (ROBIO 2014),20150423,2014,,,1839,1844,"Cloud computing framework can provide promising solutions for service robots to overcome various challenges in unstructured environments. In this paper, we present the design and implementation details of a novel cloud-based system architecture for robotic path planning. The proposed system, called Path Planning as a Service (PPaaS), is based on a three-layered architectural design: cloud server layer, cloud engine layer, and client robot layer. The cloud server layer is implemented with Hadoop Distributed File System. It contains a path plan database, which stores the solution paths that can be shared among robots. The cloud engine layer, which is the core of the architecture, utilizes Rapyuta cloud engine to create configurable containers for different robotic platforms. It also provides an on-demand path planning software in the cloud, which computes the optimal paths for robots to reach the goal positions. A load balancer is suggested to manage the container allocation in machines and coordinate local/cloud computation load balancing. The client robot layer is formed by a set of physical robots that employ PPaaS in the cloud. The communication framework of the entire system is based on Robot Operating System (ROS) platform, despite that robot clients do not necessarily run ROS.

Improved Monte Carlo localization with robust orientation estimation based on cloud computing,C. Y. Li; I. H. Li; Y. H. Chien; W. Y. Wang; C. C.

One of the most commonly used localization algorithms is Monte Carlo Localization algorithm (MCL). Unfortunately, the traditional MCL is not reliable all the time in both pose tracking and global localization. Many modified MCL algorithms have been proposed to improve the efficiency and performance, such as improved Monte Carlo Localization with robust orientation estimation algorithm (IMCLROE) proposed by the authors. However, the IMCLROE requires a lot of storage space and intensive computation, especially in a highly complicated environment. In recent years, cloud computing has been widely used because of ubiquitous network. As an attempt to solve the above problems based on cloud computing, we propose a cloud-based improved Monte Carlo Localization algorithm with robust orientation estimation with a distributed orientation estimation technique in calculating important factor of each particle. With the use of cloud computing, real-time paradox between accuracy and efficiency in a high-resolution grid map can be addressed.

3D region segmentation using topological persistence,W. J. Beksi; N.

To correctly interpret 3D point cloud data, we need to partition the dataset into regions that correspond to objects or parts of an object. In this paper, we present a region growing approach that combines global (topological) and local (color, surface normal) information to segment 3D point cloud data. Using ideas from persistent homology theory, our algorithm grows a simplicial complex representation of the point cloud dataset. At each step in the growth process we compute the zeroth homology group of the complex, which corresponds to the number of connected components, and use color and surface normal statistics to build regions. Lastly, we extract out the segmented regions of the dataset. We show that this method provides a stable segmentation of point cloud data in the presence of noise and poorly sampled data, thus providing advantages over contemporary region-based segmentation techniques.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3762-9; POD:978-1-5090-3763-6; USB:978-1-5090-3761-2,10.1109/IROS.2016.7759183,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7759183,,Face;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Object segmentation;Three-dimensional displays,cloud computing;computer graphics;image segmentation,3D point cloud data;3D region segmentation;complex representation;contemporary region-based segmentation;homology theory;point cloud dataset;stable segmentation;surface normal statistics;topological persistence;zeroth homology group,,,,,,,9-14 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Sci., Univ. of Cyprus, Nicosia, Cyprus",2012 IEEE 13th International Conference on Mobile Data Management,20121110,2012,,,324,327,"In this demonstration paper, we present a novel framework for searching objects (e.g., images, videos, etc.) captured by the users in a mobile social community. Our framework, is founded on an in-situ data storage model, where captured objects remain local on their owners smartphones and searches then take place over a novel lookup structure we compute dynamically. Initially, a query user invokes a search to find an object of interest. Our structure concurrently optimizes several conflicting objectives (i.e., it minimizes energy consumption, minimizes search delay and maximizes query recall), using a Multi-Objective Optimization approach and calculates a diverse set of high quality non-dominated Query Routing Trees (QRTs), in a single run. The optimal set is then forwarded to the query user (decision maker) to select a particular QRT to be searched based on instant requirements and preferences. To demonstrate the capabilities of SmartP2P during the conference, we will utilize our cloud of smartphone devices, i.e. the SmartLab testbed composed of 40+ Android smartphones and tablets, as well as mobility and social patterns derived by Microsofts Geolife project, DBLP and Pics n Trails. We will allow the attendees to use a real SmartLab Android device to query our local Smartphone Network using any of the four algorithmic choices provided by the SmartP2P framework. The query device will then be provided with the optimal QRTs and the attendees will be able to visually decide the optimal QRT to be searched.

The model is implemented on a social robot and allows to efficiently fuse locally perceived information with data classified remotely on a cloud. Unlike the dominant multi-class approaches, where each class is classified separately, the multi-label scheme estimates all classes simultaneously from the available input instances. This method enables a robot to capture user typical behaviour and provides a simple scheme of regulation that allows the identification of abnormal situations. We propose to solve our problem in two steps based on the principles of Binary Relevance and Label Power-set: (1) a label classification is used to filter input instances into independent labels, (2) the algorithm will map the labels into an hyper-label space, where each hyper-label represents the behaviour which maximizes input instance correlations. Results show the proposed multi-label model to achieve a highly accurate comprehension of the user behaviour even within more demanding test scenarios.

The system was boots traped using Freebase data about politicians and their pictures, and we show that the model provides a good generalization with an error rate below 7%. Meantime, FoP not only relates a person to a multimedia resource, but it also detects and publishes metadata on the position of the person in the picture. Moreover, it supports the presence of several persons in the picture. At this step, FoP is also giving data in return to the LoD cloud that fed him in the first place: it leverages Linked Data on people recognized in these pictures, and on which rectangle area. This allows fine-grained queries like creating a curation of documents in which a person is depicted relatively to another for instance.

One way to achieve robustness is to evaluate the performance of candidate grasps by sampling perturbations in shape, pose, and gripper approach and to compute the probability of force closure for each candidate to identify a grasp with the highest expected quality. Since evaluating the quality of each grasp is computationally demanding, prior work has turned to cloud computing. To improve computational efficiency and to extend this work, we consider how Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) models for optimizing decisions can be applied in this context. We formulate robust grasp planning as a MAB problem and evaluate convergence times towards an optimal grasp candidate using 100 object shapes from the Brown Vision 2D Lab Dataset with 1000 grasp candidates per object. We consider the case where shape uncertainty is represented as a Gaussian process implicit surface (GPIS) with Gaussian uncertainty in pose, gripper approach angle, and coefficient of friction. We find that Thompson Sampling and the Gittins index MAB methods converged to within 3% of the optimal grasp up to 10x faster than uniform allocation and 5x faster than iterative pruning.",2161-8070;21618070,Electronic:978-1-4673-8183-3; POD:978-1-4673-8184-0,10.1109/CoASE.2015.7294140,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7294140,,Force;Friction;Grippers;Robot sensing systems;Shape;Uncertainty,grippers;uncertain systems,2D grasp planning;GPIS;Gaussian process implicit surface;Gaussian uncertainty;Gittins index MAB methods;MAB models;Thompson sampling;cloud computing;computational efficiency;gripper approach;multiarmed bandit models;performance evaluation;robot grasping;warehouse order fulfillment,,2,,44,,,24-28 Aug. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Binaural sound localization based on time-delay compensation and spatial grid matching,B. Zhao; Z. Fu; J. Zhang; Yuezhao Chen; Runwei Ding,"Shenzhen National Engineering Laboratory of Digital Television Co., Ltd., China",2014 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Cloud Computing and Intelligence Systems,20150806,2014,,,287,291,"Binaural source localization is a popular technique in various applications, such as hearing aids, mobile robot, video conference, etc. However, robust binaural cues estimate and suitable localization strategy are always limiting its performance. In this paper, a new algorithm for binaural sound source localization is presented, which is a two-layer model. In the first layer, a spectral weighting generalized cross correlation-phase transformation (GCC-PHAT) method is presented for robust time-delay estimation, by which the probabilistic azimuths of sound source are obtained.

Smart buildings and the human-machine cloud,N. Mavridis; G. Pierris; C. BenAbdelkader; A. Krstikj; C. Karaiskos,"NCSR Demokritos, Greece",2015 IEEE 8th GCC Conference & Exhibition,20150316,2015,,,1,6,"The Human-Robot Cloud has previously been introduced as a framework for the creation of distributed, on-demand, reconfigurable human-machine cognitive systems[1]. These systems are made up of sensing, processing, and actuation components that are not limited to a specific type of application and potentially can be extended to multiple domains and may cover spatially smaller or larger areas. In this paper, we revisit the Human-Robot Cloud architecture and present its pilot deployment on the campus of NCSR Demokritos, a research institution in Greece. In particular, our concrete deployment aims to be demonstrated in three specific application scenarios; namely, Human-Aware Smart Buildings with Energy Optimization, Security and Surveillance, and Smart Tour Guide System. In this paper, we present in detail an example implementation of the Smart Buildings scenario: a real-world application with immediate benefits in energy optimization and energy savings. Environmentally sensitive issues, such as the ground-up development of energy efficient buildings or reducing the environmental impact of the existing infrastructure, has received much attention in the past. However, the traditionally offered solutions are central, non-transferable to other infrastructure, non-scalable and suffer from single points of failure. On the contrary, in this work, which is based on a specialization of the generic Human-Robot Cloud architecture, we attempt to move beyond the industrially available solutions to meet the requirements for scalable, reconfigurable and redistributable sensory, processing, and actuation units within buildings. A set of cameras, laser range finders, and other sensors, together with a number of processing and actuation elements, including face detection, expression recognition, and people trackers, are transformed to a prototypical reconfigurable distributed extended cognitive system, which can support multiple applications in the future.",,Electronic:978-1-4799-8422-0; POD:978-1-4799-8423-7; USB:978-1-4799-8421-3,10.1109/IEEEGCC.2015.7060081,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060081,,Detectors;Robot sensing systems;Smart buildings;Temperature sensors;Tracking,building management systems;cameras;cloud computing;cognitive systems;energy conservation;face recognition;human-robot interaction;image sensors;laser ranging;surveillance,Greece;NCSR Demokritos;actuation components;actuation unit;cameras;distributed on demand reconfigurable human-machine cognitive systems;energy optimization;energy savings;environmental impact;environmentally sensitive issues;expression recognition;face detection;generic human-robot cloud architecture;human-aware smart building with energy optimization security and surveillance;human-machine cloud;human-robot cloud architecture;laser range finders;people trackers;processing components;processing unit;prototypical reconfigurable distributed extended cognitive system;research institution;sensing components;sensory units;smart tour guide system,,1,,15,,,1-4 Feb. 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Application of artificial intelligence techniques for fault diagnostics of autonomous underwater vehicles,A. Inzartsev; A. Pavin; A. Kleschev; V. Gribova; G. Eliseenko,"Far Eastern Federal University, Institute for Marine Technology Problems FEB RAS, Vladivostok, Russia",OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey,20161201,2016,,,1,6,"Autonomous underwater robotic vehicles (AUVs) are equipped with monitoring and emergency systems (MESs) to increase the mission success rate. The MES ensures the AUV's safety in water and the fault tolerance of its subsystems. The signals produced by the self-test functionality of robot subsystems as well as the parameters measured by sensors are the source information for the MES. Nowadays, MES actions in the AUVs designed by the Institute for Marine Technology Problems (IMTP) are based upon the hypothesis of the isolation of signals. As a result, the robot's reaction to several quasi-simultaneous signals is not always adequate. It is possible to overcome the disadvantages of the existing version of MES with the help of an ontological approach to be used for the implementation of an intelligent MES (IMES). An IMES functions as a tactic-level agent of the information and control system can carry out diagnostic actions (submissions) if necessary. The compiler forms the IMES with the help of a preset knowledge base and description of the robotic configuration with the application of the cloud platform IACPaaS. Knowledge is a semantic network. The architecture of the AUV's IMES consists of three basic blocks: a block for the formation of knowledge on AUV fault diagnostics, a translator that translates knowledge into program code, and the AUV MES itself.

Robot control decisions can then be formulated in terms of inference tasks that are evaluated based on this knowledge during task execution.

Thus, it can enable the integration of system parts at runtime. In this paper, we define self-improvement as an adaptation of an Autonomic Computing system's adaptation logic. We present an overview of approaches for self-improvement in the domains of Autonomic Computing and self-adaptive systems.

A smartphone-cloud application as an aid for street safety inventory,A. Kattan; M. F.

This paper presents a simple, yet an effective technique to aid in reporting such street hazards automatically using a smartphone application. The smartphone's accelerometer is used to detect bumps during driving and report the data and location to cloud service. The cloud application utilizes an artificial neural network that is trained to differentiate between a â€œshockâ€ù resulting from normal driving maneuvers from those possibly resulting from road problem. It also analyzes the location and based on the frequency of reporting a certain â€œshockâ€ù data from the same geographical location it reports a street hazard location.

Automatic assets identification for smart cities: Prerequisites for cybersecurity risk assessments,K. Waedt; A. Ciriello; M. Parekh; E. Bajramovic,"Overall & Safety I&C Engineering / Cybersecurity, AREVA GmbH, Erlangen, Germany",2016 IEEE International Smart Cities Conference (ISC2),20161003,2016,,,1,6,"Generally speaking, an asset is something that has a potential or actual value for an organization. In the context of this paper the concept of the â€œorganizationâ€ù has to be extended to comprise a smart city or a compound structure of smart cities interrelated at different administrative, legislative, geographical and technical levels. The management of an asset portfolio is generically introduced by ISO 55000. Management of fixed assets is a process that seeks to track assets for the purpose of financial accounting, theft prevention, preventive maintenance etc. Software asset management (SAM), as covered by ISO/IEC 19770-5, addresses processes and technology for managing software and related IT assets. These digital assets are key enablers for most activities in a world of smart cities. The fact that systematic asset management is currently enforced only in a few, heavily regulated business domains indicates that, at a smart city level, this will be a daunting challenge. The focus of this paper is on the manual and automatic asset identification, annotation and tracking as well as on the assignment of graded application security controls (ASCs) that can benefit from a comprehensive and formalized asset management. This includes the availability and integrity of fixed and mobile information technology (IT) assets connected to wired and wireless networks and the reliability and integrity of software assets installed on servers and cloud environments. Asset identification is a precondition for the safe application of security patches and for conducting risk assessments with consideration of version and patch-level specific dependencies between software components. Rigorous and pervasive asset management provides value beyond security, for example with regard to a more efficient use of software license pools or other temporarily assigned resources (like exchangeable battery packs) or resources needed on demand (like smart healthcar- robots). Unfortunately, new concerns are also raised, as semi-formal asset descriptions, enhanced details on links between assets and the simplified tracking of assets may be misused for sophisticated attacks targeting combinations of version specific vulnerabilities. For selected ongoing smart city related projects this paper addresses the stringent need of adding a semi-formal asset management, the immediate benefits and the expected progressive benefits derived e.g. from model-based guidance that relies on the asset specific intelligence.",,,10.1109/ISC2.2016.7580812,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7580812,application security controls;asset management tools;asset portfolio;automatic asset identification;smart cities,Asset management;Context;Organizations;Portfolios;Security;Smart cities;Software,asset management;cloud computing;risk management;security of data;smart cities,ASC;asset management;automatic assets identification;cloud environments;cybersecurity risk assessments;fixed information technology;graded application security control assignment;manual asset identification;mobile information technology;pervasive asset management;security patches;semiformal asset management;smart cities;software assets;software components,,,,,,,12-15 Sept. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

It further complements Internet of Things (IoT) to improve the performance of smart city applications. By offloading heavy data- intensive computation to the ubiquitous cloud, quality of service (QoS) guarantee can be ensured. Unlike their mobile counterpart, the robots have unique characteristics of mobility, skill- learning, data collection and decision-making capabilities, which makes offloading decisions significantly complex. This paper proposes a generic cloud robotics framework to realize smart city vision while taking into consideration its various complexities. Specifically, task offloading is formulated as a constrained optimization problem capable of handling Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) known as task flow. Given the constraints, a genetic algorithm (GA) based scheme is further developed to solve the problem. The performance of the algorithm is verified by evaluating the results via three benchmarks.

Google Docs, Microsoft Office Web Apps, Zoho Office Suite are such representative cloud backed co-editing services. People from different organizations may choose different service providers, which implies the needs of cross-cloud document collaboration. However, it is hard to make different collaborative editing services interoperate with each other. On the one hand, it is not realistic to let all service providers comply to a unified standard and provide interoperation interfaces. On the other hand, the challenge of consistency maintenance in real-time document synchronization still exists. These make interoperability one of the most significant collaboration barriers in online collaborative editing.

Real-Time Multisensor Data Retrieval for Cloud Robotic Systems,L. Wang; M. Liu; M. Q. H. Meng,"Department of Electronic Engineering, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong",IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,20150403,2015,12,2,507,518,"Cloud technology elevates the potential of robotics with which robots possessing various capabilities and resources may share data and combine new skills through cooperation. With multiple robots, a cloud robotic system enables intensive and complicated tasks to be carried out in an optimal and cooperative manner. Multisensor data retrieval (MSDR) is one of the key fundamental tasks to share the resources. Having attracted wide attention, MSDR is facing severe technical challenges. For example, MSDR is particularly difficult when cloud cluster hosts accommodate unpredictable data requests triggered by multiple robots operating in parallel. In these cases, near real-time responses are essential while addressing the problem of the synchronization of multisensor data simultaneously. In this paper, we present a framework targeting near real-time MSDR, which grants asynchronous access to the cloud from the robots. We propose a market-based management strategy for efficient data retrieval. It is validated by assessing several quality-of-service (QoS) criteria, with emphasis on facilitating data retrieval in near real-time. Experimental results indicate that the MSDR framework is able to achieve excellent performance under the proposed management strategy in typical cloud robotic scenarios.",1545-5955;15455955,,10.1109/TASE.2015.2408634,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060735,Cloud robotic system;multisensor fusion;real-time data retrieval,Optimization;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Resource management;Robot sensing systems,cloud computing;quality of service;sensor fusion;sensors;service robots;synchronisation,QoS criteria;asynchronous access;cloud cluster hosts;cloud robotic scenarios;cloud robotic systems;cloud technology;market-based management strategy;multiple robots;quality of service criteria;real-time MSDR framework;real-time multisensor data retrieval;real-time responses;synchronization;unpredictable data requests,,10,,54,,20150313,Apr-15,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

Breakthrough of 6% people productivity improvement via the development of Cloud Monitor,Y. H. Chen; C. J. Huang; C. L. Wang,"tsmc, Hsinchu, Taiwan",2013 e-Manufacturing & Design Collaboration Symposium (eMDC),20140306,2013,,,1,3,"To maintain high stability and production yield of production equipment in a semiconductor fab, on-line quality monitoring of wafers is required. In current practice, physical metrology is performed only on monitor wafers that are periodically added in production equipment for processing with production wafers. In addition to control wafers usage and loss of tool availability, however, routine monitoring does result in a huge cost of manual operation loading. This is equivalent to about 15% loss of people productivity. To give consideration to quality control and people productivity improvement, the system of Cloud Monitor (CM) is proposed based on stepwise regression and principle component analysis (PCA). The CM is verified by test-runs on the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) processes. Eight monitor items are considered. The CM is effective to construct forecast models with 1.34% mean absolute prediction errors (MAPE) and 100% OOC catch rate (OCR). The experimental results indicate that the CM is capable of predicting quality of production wafers using real-time sensor data from production equipment.

Users operate VS remotely through the thin-client of VSP on physical smartphones, and ignore the limits of physical mobile devices. The isolation of VS in cloud platform guarantees the security between VSes, and also prevents access to private sensitive information on physical devices.

The experiment results shows that this model can effectively regulate the emotional states in the human-robot interaction, and can obviously improve the robot's humanoid, intelligent degree, and interactive effect. This model is in line with the psychological significance in the experiment and simulation, and enables the robot to get rid of the mechanical emotional transferring process.",2376-5933;23765933,Electronic:978-1-4673-1857-0; POD:978-1-4673-1856-3,10.1109/CCIS.2012.6664292,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6664292,Cognitive-affective regulation;Emotional states space;Micro-expression;Relationship coefficient;Transferring probability,Attenuation;Cognition;Eyelids;Mouth;Psychology;Robots;Stress,cognitive systems;emotion recognition;human-robot interaction;humanoid robots,Gross model;active field state space;attenuation function;cognitive reappraisal;cognitive reasoning process;cognitive-affective regulation process;emotional states transferring process;human-robot interaction;humanoid robot;mechanical emotional transferring process;microexpressions;psychological energy;recognition method;relationship coefficient;robot emotional states;robot external stimulus;robot intelligent degree;robot interactive effect;threshold function,,0,,16,,,Oct. 30 2012-Nov. 1 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Mobile cloud computing services (MCCS) has incited an innovative surge of advancement in the fast emerging pervasive computing. Although a number of studies have been carried out in the area of mobile technology, the subject of the readiness of the mobile operating systems, such as Android, IOS and Windows Mobile in MCCS is immensely being unexplored. Challenges and architecture for a suitable MCCS have been defined in this paper. It goes to develop criteria to measure the various Mobile Operating System (MOS) offerings to identify the additional features that should be implemented on MOS to enable and/or enhance that efficient MCCS. This paper also analyses the readiness of MOS to meet the challenges of offering these MCCSs. An in-depth study of the current requirements and challenges are identified, hence criteria is formed that is used to compare these current Smartphone MOS. This paper concludes that mobile virtualisation and security needs to be explored by MOS providers in order to enhance license IP separation, portability, reliability, security, and the consolidation of hardware amongst Smartphones, mobile network operators and MCCS providers. This will aid widening the scope for defining Smartphones as the CCS platform.",2157-0221;21570221,Electronic:978-1-4673-2017-7; POD:978-1-4673-2016-0,10.1109/ICUMT.2012.6459717,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6459717,Android;Cloud computing services;Mobile cloud computing services;Mobile operating systems;Pervasive computing,Androids;Cloud computing;Humanoid robots;Mobile communication;Operating systems;Security;Smart phones,cloud computing;industrial property;mobile computing;operating systems (computers);security of data;smart phones;software architecture;software reliability;virtualisation,Android;CCS platform;IOS;MCCS;MOS;Windows Mobile;hardware consolidation;license IP portability enhancement;license IP reliability enhancement;license IP security enhancement;license IP separation enhancement;mobile cloud computing services;mobile devices;mobile operating systems;mobile technology;mobile virtualisation;pervasive computing;security needs;smartphones;tablets,,0,,27,,,3-5 Oct. 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Our experiments showed that vision based mapping helps agents navigate in unknown environments using feature based mapping and localization. Instead of using a classical monocular camera as a vision source, we have decided to use RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue, Depth) cameras for better feature detection, 3D mapping, and localization. This is due to the fact that the RGB-D camera returns depth data as well as the normal RGB data. Moreover, we have applied this method on multiple robots using the concept of cooperative SLAM.

Pratt,"Open Source Robotics Foundation, Mountain View, CA, USA",IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,20150403,2015,12,2,494,506,"This paper presents the software framework established to facilitate cloud-hosted robot simulation. The framework addresses the challenges associated with conducting a task-oriented and real-time robot competition, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Virtual Robotics Challenge (VRC), designed to mimic reality. The core of the framework is the Gazebo simulator, a platform to simulate robots, objects, and environments, as well as the enhancements made for the VRC to maintain a high fidelity simulation using a high degree of freedom and multisensor robot. The other major component used is the CloudSim tool, designed to enhance the automation of robotics simulation using existing cloud technologies. The results from the VRC and a discussion are also detailed in this work. Note to Practitioners - Advances in robot simulation, cloud hosted infrastructure, and web technology have made it possible to accurately and efficiently simulate complex robots and environments on remote servers while providing realistic data streams for human-in-the-loop robot control. This paper presents the software and hardware frameworks established to facilitate cloud-hosted robot simulation, and addresses the challenges associated with conducting a task-oriented robot competition designed to mimic reality. The competition that spurred this innovation was the VRC, a precursor to the DARPA Robotics Challenge, in which teams from around the world utilized custom human-robot interfaces and control code to solve disaster response-related tasks in simulation. Winners of the VRC received both funding and access to Atlas, a humanoid robot developed by Boston Dynamics. The Gazebo simulator, an open source and high fidelity robot simulator, was improved upon to met the needs of the VRC competition. Additionally, CloudSim was created to act as an interface between users and the cloud-hosted simulations. As a result of this work, we have achieved automated deployment of cloud resources f- r robotic simulations, near real-time simulation performance, and simulation accuracy that closely mimics real hardware. These tools have been released under open source licenses and are freely available, and can be used to help reduce robot and algorithm design and development time, and increase robot software robustness.",1545-5955;15455955,,10.1109/TASE.2014.2368997,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014315,Cloud robotics;real-time robot simulation;robotic disaster response,Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computers;Real-time systems;Robot sensing systems;Servers,cloud computing;control engineering computing;digital simulation;human-robot interaction;humanoid robots;public domain software;rescue robots,Atlas humanoid robot;CloudSim tool;DARPA;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency;Gazebo simulator;VRC;Web technology;cloud-hosted robot simulation;human-in-the-loop robot control;human-robot interfaces;multisensor robot;open source robot simulator;real-time robot competition;real-time robotic disaster response;software framework;task-oriented robot competition;virtual robotics challenge,,12,,32,,20150119,Apr-15,,IEEE,IEEE Journals & Magazines

We evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms through simulation and provide a real implementation on the Android platform using the Wi-Fi Direct framework.

We decided to explore what was possible at the intersection of robotics, the Web, and mobile devices by creating a mobile web interface for a humanoid robot. This paper describes our implementation of a monitoring interface for high degree of freedom (DOF) robots that works with both desktop and mobile devices. Using only standard web technologies, our application provides a rich 3D interface that displays the robot's pose, orientation, and sensor data, and can update at 30Hz. It is easy to use, because there is no software for the user to install; it runs using the device's mobile browser. The web interface can be deployed on a private or public cloud, and is designed to scale to support hundreds or thousands of viewers by utilizing cloud services.

Cloud computing and visual attention based object detection for power substation surveillance robots,Y. Jian; W. Xin; Z. Xue; D.

The detection results can be used for recognizing an object, tracking a specified object and construction a map of environments, etc. In the substation surveillance application, the detection results can be used to locate the target object and segment out from the whole image for next analysis. Visual attention, which has drawn much attention of researchers in the machine vision field, is an effective tool for object detection. It tends to reduce the search area by simulating the mechanism of human vision which can focus on the significant target quickly and others are ignored. However, to compute the visual attention saliency map is a resource consumption work, the onboard hardware capacity limits the whole system performance. Additionally, hundreds of surveillance robots are working in different substation, a continually updated target library needs to be shared with each robot, it is impossible for the onboard resources to maintain all the historical data and learning from it. In this paper, a cloud based visual attention objects detection method was proposed. Cloud computing technology is adopted to extend the computing and storage ability of the local robots. All the data can save in the cloud and the computing resources can be on demand dynamically allocated. Furthermore, a visual attention based object detection algorithm is also proposed, to obtain the most salient region (MSR) in the whole image, then the SURF matching is implemented to detect the object, if the target object is inside MSR, it will be segmented out not only for analysis, but also used for update the target library.

The second is that even if their software is open source, low-cost robots usually lack sufficient resources such as CPU power or memory capabilities, thus forbidding advanced algorithms to be executed in-robot. Within the context of RAPP (Robotic Applications for Delivering Smart User Empowering Applications) we treat robots as platforms, where applications can be downloaded and automatically deployed.

Fusing laser point cloud and visual image at data level using a new reconstruction algorithm,L. Zhou,"State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China",2013 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV),20131015,2013,,,1356,1361,"Camera and LIDAR provide complementary information for robots to perceive the environment. In this paper, we present a system to fuse laser point cloud and visual information at the data level. Generally, cameras and LIDARs mounted on the unmanned ground vehicle have different viewports. Some objects which are visible to a LIDAR may become invisible to a camera. This will result in false depth assignment for the visual image and incorrect colorization for laser points. The inputs of the system are a color image and the corresponding LIDAR data. Coordinates of 3D laser points are first transformed into the camera coordinate system. Points outside the camera viewing volume are clipped. A new algorithm is proposed to recreate the underlying object surface of the potentially visible laser points as quadrangle mesh by exploiting the structure of the LIDAR as a priori. False edge is eliminated by constraining the angle between the laser scan trace and the radial direction of a given laser point, and quadrangles with non-consistent normal are pruned. In addition, the missing laser points are solved to avoid large holes in the reconstructed mesh. At last z-buffer algorithm is used to work for occlusion reasoning. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the previous one. It can assign correct depth information to the visual image and provide the exact color to each laser point which is visible to the camera.",1931-0587;19310587,Electronic:978-1-4673-2755-8; POD:978-1-4673-2753-4,10.1109/IVS.2013.6629655,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6629655,,Cameras;Image reconstruction;Laser fusion;Laser radar;Three-dimensional displays;Visualization,cameras;cloud computing;hidden feature removal;image colour analysis;image reconstruction;mobile robots;optical radar;optical scanners;radar imaging;remotely operated vehicles;telerobotics,3D laser points;LIDAR data;camera;camera coordinate system;camera viewing volume;color image;data level;false depth assignment;false edge;laser point cloud fusion;laser scan trace;missing laser points;occlusion reasoning;quadrangle mesh;reconstruction algorithm;unmanned ground vehicle;visual image;visual information;z-buffer algorithm,,1,,12,,,23-26 June 2013,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Broker architecture for collaborative UAVs cloud computing,S. Mahmoud; N. Mohamed,"The College of Information Technology, UAEU, Al Ain, UAE",2015 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS),20150820,2015,,,212,219,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are used, in addition to the military, in various civilian applications. Some UAV applications may involve multiple UAVs working and collaborating together to achieve a common goal. Developing such applications is time and effort consuming due to the heterogeneity of UAVs and the complexity of the operations involved. These UAVs are usually monitored and controlled using peer-to-peer radio frequency communications. This requires either direct links between the UAVs and the ground station, or through multiple hops between them. This approach suffers from many limitations and it forces the user(s) to be at the mission location. In addition, it restricts the mission's area within the range of UAV communication. Overcome this issue, we propose a platform architecture that integrates the UAVs with the cloud computing paradigm, so that UAVs become as servers and part of the cloud. We modeled the UAVs in a Resources-Oriented Architecture (ROA); they provide their resources and services through the uniform interface RESTful HTTP. For distributed UAVs, we propose a broker architecture to separate the requester side from the provider side.

In developing countries, due to lack of resources and expertise, autism is detected later than early ages which consequently delays timely intervention. Therefore a mobile, interactive and integrated framework is proposed to screen and confirm autism in different age group (0 to 17 years) with 3 layers of assessment process. Firstly, it screens by evaluating the responses of pictorial based screening questionnaire through mobile application. If autism is suspected, then in virtual assessment process, the child watches a video, its reaction is recorded and uploaded to the cloud for remote expert assessment. If autism is still suspected, then the child is referred to the nearest Autism Resource Center (ARC) for actual assessment. Analyzing these results, the integrated framework confirms autism automatically and reduce user's ARC visit. It is expected that the proposed framework will bring changes in autism diagnosis process and create awareness.",1557-170X;1557170X,Electronic:978-1-4577-0220-4; POD:978-1-4577-0219-8,10.1109/EMBC.2016.7592093,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7592093,,Autism;Cloud computing;Delays;Mobile communication;Pediatrics;Robots;Smart devices,diagnostic expert systems;interactive systems;medical disorders,Autism Resource Center;autism confirmation;autism screening;integrated framework;interactive framework;mobile;pictorial based screening questionnaire;remote expert assessment;smart autism,,,,,,,16-20 Aug. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

The vulnerabilities caused by the limited security models, coarse permission system and code flaws lead to private information leakage, deny of service, potential costs, etc. To detect these vulnerabilities, some analysis and security testing methods have been presented. However, most of these methods focus on certain aspects, for example, applications, permission, or capability leakage. In this paper, we propose a new detection paradigm named Fuzzing Cloud to detect vulnerabilities in Android system. Firstly, the architecture of fuzzing cloud is introduced, and the fuzzing nodes are investigated. Then, each layer of the Android system is decomposed into separated modules, and the fuzzing test cases are created with the endless capacity of processing power and storage in fuzzing cloud. Finally, the prototype of fuzzing cloud has been implemented, and some separated modules have been tested. The experiment results show that some vulnerabilities can be detected by the fuzzing cloud.

This concept utilizes the recent technology of mobile cloud computing for presenting a set of resources in multiple UAVs as a set of mobile cloud services. The cloud services in addition to ground cloud computing services can be used together to enable the development and operations of collaborative UAVs. In the proposed cloud, special collaboration methods are offered as services to reduce the time and cost of development hence they become plug and play components to be used when needed. This proposed cloud offers different opportunities in UAVs applications development and deployment; however, some technical challenges are present and need to be addressed before the actual benefits can be realized at a cost-effective price.

Such places, in fact, very often are not equipped to provide access for mobility impaired people, in particular because these aids require dedicated infrastructures that may not fit within the environment and large investments. For this reason, people affected by mobility impairments are often unable to enjoy a part or even the entire museum experience. Solutions allowing mobility impaired people to enjoy museum experience are often based on recorded tours, thus they do not allow active participation of the user. On the contrary, the presented platform is intended to allow users to enjoy completely the museum round. A robot equipped with a camera is placed within the museum and users can control it in order to follow predefined tours or freely explore the museum. Our solution ensures that users see exactly what the robot is seing in real-time. The cloud robotics platform controls both navigation capabilities and teleoperation.

The Android platform employs permission mechanism to protect intensive information from illegal leakage. There are several tools to assist users to manage apps' permissions, such as App Ops, Privacy Guard, and XPrivacy. However, the permission mechanism of Android is complicated, and only a few of smartphone users are familiar with Android security mechanism. In addition, it is difficult for smartphone users to know whether the privacy information exposure by Android applications is legal or not. Reverse engineering and program data flow analysis are basic approaches to analysis applications. Although it needs analysts to manual analysis results, its efficiency is largely depends on analysts' skills and experience. To improve analysis efficiency, we take a case-based reasoning method to simulation the security expert analysis applications.

Using a mobile device such as a mobile phone or a tablet computer, DIMP is capable of writing source codes and compiling. DIMP consists of a mobile application, a central server and a set of compilation servers, while an administrative web console supports the administrative functions. Together, they comprise DIMP. The mobile application is an android application and provides a rich source code editor integrated to the software. It allows compiling and running of source codes where users can write programs in a selected language. If the source code is error free, a user can expect a worthwhile output whereas an error prone source code would reveal the relevant error message with useful hints for debugging. A further benefit from DIMP is that it allows a user to maintain online work space as well as an offline workspace.

Urban scene segmentation with laser-constrained CRFs,C. De Alvis; L. Ott; F. Ramos,"School of Information Technologies, The University of Sydney, Australia",2016 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS),20161201,2016,,,2147,2154,"Robots typically possess sensors of different modalities, such as colour cameras, inertial measurement units, and 3D laser scanners. Often, solving a particular problem becomes easier when more than one modality is used. However, while there are undeniable benefits to combine sensors of different modalities the process tends to be complicated. Segmenting scenes observed by the robot into a discrete set of classes is a central requirement for autonomy as understanding the scene is the first step to reason about future situations. Scene segmentation is commonly performed using either image data or 3D point cloud data. In computer vision many successful methods for scene segmentation are based on conditional random fields (CRF) where the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution to the segmentation can be obtained by inference. In this paper we devise a new CRF inference method for scene segmentation that incorporates global constraints, enforcing the sets of nodes are assigned the same class label. To do this efficiently, the CRF is formulated as a relaxed quadratic program whose MAP solution is found using a gradient-based optimisation approach. The proposed method is evaluated on images and 3D point cloud data gathered in urban environments where image data provides the appearance features needed by the CRF, while the 3D point cloud data provides global spatial constraints over sets of nodes. Comparisons with belief propagation, conventional quadratic programming relaxation, and higher order potential CRF show the benefits of the proposed method.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-3762-9; POD:978-1-5090-3763-6; USB:978-1-5090-3761-2,10.1109/IROS.2016.7759337,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7759337,,Cameras;Image segmentation;Robot vision systems;Three-dimensional displays,cloud computing;data handling;image segmentation;quadratic programming;robot vision,3D point cloud data;CRF inference method;MAP;computer vision;conditional random fields;gradient-based optimisation approach;image data;laser-constrained CRF;maximum-a-posteriori solution;quadratic programming relaxation;relaxed quadratic program;robots;urban scene segmentation,,,,,,,9-14 Oct. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

After briefly reviewing its anticipated impact on society and infrastructure requirements, we then provide an up-to-date survey of recent progress and enabling technologies proposed for the Tactile Internet.

The algorithm uses a Multi- Armed Bandit model with correlated rewards to leverage prior grasps and 3D object models in a growing dataset that currently includes over 10,000 unique 3D object models and 2.5 million parallel-jaw grasps. Each grasp includes an estimate of the probability of force closure under uncertainty in object and gripper pose and friction. Dex-Net 1.0 uses Multi-View Convolutional Neural Networks (MV-CNNs), a new deep learning method for 3D object classification, to provide a similarity metric between objects, and the Google Cloud Platform to simultaneously run up to 1,500 virtual cores, reducing experiment runtime by up to three orders of magnitude. Experiments suggest that correlated bandit techniques can use a cloud-based network of object models to significantly reduce the number of samples required for robust grasp planning.

Today's cloud computing has become the buzzword (i.e. pay as you go) in the computing world. As extension of cloud technology, vehicle used cloud services to exchange communications over road network. Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) were primarily designed to support the communication between totally different vehicles (V2V) and therefore the communication between vehicles and the margin infrastructures (V2I). Vehicle Cloud Computing (VCC) is a new field of research that aims to study vehicle agents (people, vehicles, robots etc.) as they interact and collaborate to sense the environment, process the data, propagate the results and more generally share resources to exchanges communication. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, missing potential customers and revenue. Trust is an essential concern for vehicle users during using cloud services. Vehicles used location based services (during user's journey) to find the nearest location, point of interest etc. This paper aims to reduce that confusion by clarifying terms between vehicular network and vehicular cloud, and provides trusted services to vehicle users with opportunities of Cloud Computing.",,Electronic:978-1-5090-1111-7; POD:978-1-5090-1112-4,10.1109/RAINS.2016.7764391,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7764391,Cloud Computing;Network;Safety and Non-Safety applications;Trust;Vehicular Ad-Hoc,Cloud computing;Hardware;Roads;Software as a service;Vehicles,ad hoc networks;cloud computing;telecommunication computing;traffic engineering computing,V2I;V2V;VANET;VCC;cloud technology;road network;trust enabled services;vehicle users;vehicular ad-hoc networks;vehicular cloud computing,,,,,,,6-7 May 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

In this paper, we propose a novel remote protection mechanism for mobile apps in cloud computing environments. In the proposed mechanism, the app should download and execute some code from the cloud when some important function is called.

Unlike using stand-alone speech recognition/ synthesis toolkits, a cloud robotics platform for human-robot communication enables high-quality speech recognition and synthesis that is optimized to human-robot interactions. This is challenging because we need to build a wide variety of functionalities ranging from a stable cloud platform to high-quality multilingual speech recognition and synthesis engines. From this background, we constructed rospeex [1], which is a cloud robotics platform for multilingual spoken dialogues with robots.

As the data centers grow larger, data center management techniques have evolved from a simple alert system into a critical element that enables maximum availability, cost efficiency, and controllability. In this paper, we present a mobile robot-based data center management system called, SCOUT with a cost efficiency and scalability. It is an extended work of our previous work called FalconEye which is a vision-based monitoring system for the maintenance of data centers. Unlike our previous works, we advanced our system by deploying mobile robot platform so that it takes an advantage of monitorability and system controllability. SCOUT is comprised of the following three novel mechanisms: ground integrated NFC tags enabling for the robots to recognize the exact position for a system monitoring; efficient path construction algorithm for a low latency patrol with a fixed number of robots; and the robot path adaptation to maximize the robot utilization. To evaluate the feasibility and practicality of the SCOUT design, we built a prototype of the data center management system with a real robot platform and successfully deployed into iCubeCloud testbed.

Here we present a non-monologue speech synthesis for robots. We collected a speech corpus in a non-monologue style in which two professional voice talents read scripted dialogues. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) were then trained with the corpus and used for speech synthesis. We conducted experiments in which the proposed method was evaluated by 24 subjects in three scenarios: text-reading, dialogue, and domestic service robot (DSR) scenarios.

Control of multi-agent systems with event-triggered cloud access,A. Adaldo; D. Liuzza; D. V. Dimarogonas; K. H. Johansson,"ACCESS Linneaus Center and School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden",2015 European Control Conference (ECC),20151123,2015,,,954,961,"This paper investigates a multi-agent formation control problem with event-triggered control updates and additive disturbances. The agents communicate only by exchanging information in a cloud repository. The communication with the cloud is considered a shared and limited resource, and therefore it is used intermittently and asynchronously by the agents. The proposed approach takes advantage of having a shared asynchronous cloud support while guaranteeing a reduced number of communication. More in detail, each agent schedules its own sequence of cloud accesses in order to achieve a coordinated network goal. A control law is given with a criterion for scheduling the control updates recursively. The closed loop scheme is proven to be effective in achieving the control objective and a numerical simulation corroborates the theoretical results.",,Electronic:978-3-9524-2693-7; POD:978-1-4673-7160-5,10.1109/ECC.2015.7330665,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7330665,,Control systems;Databases;Global Positioning System;Multi-agent systems;Sea surface;Symmetric matrices;Vehicles,closed loop systems;cloud computing;control engineering computing;multi-robot systems;numerical analysis,additive disturbances;closed loop scheme;cloud repository;coordinated network goal;event-triggered cloud access;event-triggered control updates;multiagent formation control problem;numerical simulation;shared asynchronous cloud support,,1,,24,,,15-17 July 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Having the cloud in the loop has many purposes including increasing computation, decreasing â€œon robotâ€ù power usage, reducing overall robot weight etc. Today when robots use the cloud in loop it is typically for sharing information, high level planning, and other non-real-time tasks. All of the balancing and stability algorithms stay onboard the robot. What if we could run high frequency real-time loops over the cloud? The better question is how would we do that? As with any real-time system latency is a big factor in the application and operation frequency. This paper shows that with a geographically adjacent and bounty hunting server approach it is feasible to obtain high frequency real-time control in loop with with a physical robot over the cloud.

ClassifyDroid: Large scale Android applications classification using semi-supervised Multinomial Naive Bayes,F. Dong; Y. Guo; C. Li; G. Xu; F.

Classification on large scale Android applications has attracted great interest from both researchers and practitioners. However, most existing approaches are supervised learning method which needs lots of labeled data. Their use in practice is often limited due to lack of labeled data, large scale Android applications, or high manual label cost. In this paper, we present a novel large scale Android applications classification tool using semi-supervised Multinomial Naive Bayes (SMNB) algorithm, called ClassifyDroid. Our proposed model exploits SMNB algorithm widely used in text document analysis. The approach is based on the analysis of characteristic application program interface (API), which can be seen as equivalents to the words and keywords in a text document. Namely, each application is characterized as a vector according to the characteristic API in it, with the associated frequencies. We evaluated ClassifyDroid on 15590 samples chosen from mobile market (MM) App Store. Our experiments show that ClassifyDroid is both accurate and practical, which has a better classification result than MNB algorithm when the dataset contains little labeled applications and lots of unlabeled applications.",,CD:978-1-5090-1254-1; Electronic:978-1-5090-1256-5; POD:978-1-5090-1257-2,10.1109/CCIS.2016.7790228,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7790228,Android applications;Multinomial Naive Bayes;Semi-supervised;large scale classification,Androids;Classification algorithms;Decision support systems;Gold;Humanoid robots;Integrated circuits,Android (operating system);application program interfaces;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;pattern classification;text analysis,API characteristic;Android applications classification;Big Data;ClassifyDroid;MM;SMNB algorithm;application program interface characteristic;labeled data;manual label cost;mobile applications;mobile market App Store;semi-supervised multinomial Naive Bayes;supervised learning method;text document analysis,,,,,,,17-19 Aug. 2016,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

However, due to the mobility of physical objects and to the short radio range of the wireless interfaces they are equipped with, frequent and unpredictable connectivity disruptions may occur between the physical objects and the Web clients used to control and access these objects. This paper presents a disruption-tolerant RESTful support for the WoT, in which resources offered by physical objects are identified by URIs and accessed through stateless services. Service requests and responses are forwarded using the store-carry-and-forward principle, and can be cached by intermediate nodes. A complete service invocation model is provided, allowing to perform unicast, anycast, multicast and broadcast service invocations either using HTTP or CoAP, which makes it particularly suited for the WoT.

In a typical IaaS scenario, an infrastructure provider offers his resources on demand and with different service levels to his customers. These service levels are mainly distinguished by the amount of computing power a customer is guaranteed to receive within a time frame. In our a model, each service level is described by a slack factor and a price for a processing time unit. If the provider accepts a job it is guaranteed to complete by its deadline, that is its submission time plus its processing time times the slack factor of assigned service level. After a job has been submitted, the provider must decide immediately and irrevocably whether he accepts or rejects the job. We suggest various algorithms and use competitive analysis to discuss different scenarios for this model. These scenarios combine fixed services levels with the single machine model or the parallel identical machines model. Particularly, we demonstrate the benefit of parallelism by showing that we can achieve better competitive factor in a parallel machine scenario than in the corresponding single machine scenario.",,Electronic:978-0-7695-4676-6; POD:978-1-4673-0974-5,10.1109/IPDPSW.2012.130,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6270756,cloud computing;competitive factors;online scheduling;service levels;slack factor,Computational modeling;Processor scheduling;Real time systems;Schedules;Scheduling;Silicon;Upper bound,cloud computing;parallel machines;processor scheduling,IaaS;cloud computing;competitive analysis;competitive factor;infrastructure as a service;online scheduling;parallel identical machines model;service level;single machine model;slack factor,,6,,9,,,21-25 May 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

COAST: A Connected Open plAtform for Smart objecTs,Zhe Li; J. C. Point,"JCP-Connect, Rennes, France",2015 2nd International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Disaster Management (ICT-DM),20160211,2015,,,166,172,"Quick reactions and rescues are critical requirements in disaster and emergency management. However, the decision on how to react should be taken based on the correct judgment on the disaster situation. Nowadays ICT plays a pivotal role in the decision-making in disasters management. Particularly, the IoT technology is indispensable for information collection and analysis. Despite the rapid development in the ICT domain, the real-time analysis and response in certain emergency is still impossible. This is mainly due to the lack of computation power of thin smart objects and the vertical isolation among IoT applications. In this work, we will introduce the Connected Open plAtform for Smart objecTs (COAST) that gives smart objects, such as robots, drones and smartphones, the capability to autonomously negotiate and deploy additional resources on itself, on other objects or in the cloud. The overall goal of the COAST platform is to give the capability to smart object applications to self-adapt to the runtime context by providing an interoperable platform for real-time discovery, negotiation and on-the-fly allocation of additional resources. These resources can be provided by remote sensors, by on-demand deployment of additional - possibly 3rd party - services on the same or another smart object, or by outsourcing computation to edge cloud infrastructure tailored for high-performance and real-time computation. COAST provides the necessary platform services supporting run-time adaptation, monitoring, big data analytics. To allow the secure deployment of 3rd party application components on smart objects, the COAST provides a novel virtualization layer that supports high-performance execution through hardware accelerators. Expected performance will be reported to highlight the benefits of introducing such a platform to the IoT services in disaster management.",,Electronic:978-1-4799-9923-1; POD:978-1-4799-9924-8; USB:978-1-4799-9922-4,10.1109/ICT-DM.2015.7402060,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7402060,,Cloud computing;Context;Drones;Performance evaluation;Real-time systems;Robot sensing systems;Runtime,decision making;electric sensing devices;emergency management;real-time systems,COAST;IoT technology;connected open platform for smart object;decision-making;disaster management;drones;emergency management;hardware accelerators;information collection;on-the-fly allocation;real-time discovery;remote sensors;robots;runtime context;smartphones;virtualization layer,,,,41,,,Nov. 30 2015-Dec. 2 2015,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

Taiwan Univ., Taipei, Taiwan",2011 Fifth International Conference on Innovative Mobile and Internet Services in Ubiquitous Computing,20110804,2011,,,20,27,"Modern smart phones have made many pervasive computing dreams come true. Still, many mobile applications do not perform well due to the shortage of resources for computation, data storage, network bandwidth, and battery capacity. While such applications can be re-designed with client-server models to benefit from cloud services, the users are no longer in full control of the application, which has become a serious concern. We proposed a cloud/mobile execution framework to execute mobile applications in a cloud-based virtualized execution environment controlled by mobile applications and users, with encryption and isolation to protect against eavesdropping from cloud providers. We have developed efficient schemes for migrating applications and synchronizing data between execution environments.

The Human-Robot Cloud: Situated collective intelligence on demand,N. Mavridis; T. Bourlai; D. Ognibene,"New York University AD, PO Box 129188, Abu Dhabi, UAE","2012 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems (CYBER)",20121224,2012,,,360,365,"The Human-Robot Cloud (HRC) is an innovative extension of Cloud Computing across two important directions: First, while traditional cloud computing enables transparent utilization of distributed computational as well as storage resources, the HRC enables, in addition to the above two, the utilization of (a) distributed sensing (sensor network technology) and (b) actuator networks (including robot networks). Thus, HRC extends the concept of cloud computing by connecting it to the â€œPhysical Worldâ€ù, through sensing and action. Second, while traditional cloud computing involves the usage of only electronic components, such as computers and storage devices, the HRC's capability is extended by the support of human physical and cognitive â€œcomponentsâ€ù as part of the cloud, which are neither expected to be experts nor to be engaged with the cloud full-time. Such components are primarily expected to interact with the system for only short periods of time (seconds), essentially providing crowd-servicing for the Cloud. Human components provide any or a mixture of the following: a) input arising from a number of sources through the usage of their sensory faculties (auditory, visual etc.), - thus, acting as â€œintelligent sensorsâ€ù attached to the cloud; b) input that results from the usage of their cognitive faculties (pattern recognition, prediction, identification, planning etc.) - thus, acting as â€œintelligent systemsâ€ù attached to the cloud; and c) actuation services to the Cloud (by moving around their bodies or other objects) - thus acting as â€œactuatorsâ€ù attached to the cloud. Thus, the proposed HRC is aiming to achieve the best of both worlds, i.e., either humans or machines, being able to carry out tasks which are very difficult or impossible for either humans or machines alone to carry out. Furthermore, the HRC enables the construction of situated agents exhibiting collective intelligence on de- and, and the transformation of situated agency from a â€œcapital investmentâ€ù to a service, components of which can be provided by multiple providers, in a transparent fashion to the end user.",,DVD:978-1-4673-1419-0; Electronic:978-1-4673-1421-3; POD:978-1-4673-1420-6,10.1109/CYBER.2012.6392580,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392580,cloud computing;crowd-servicing;crowd-sourcing;human computation;robots;sensor networks,Cloud computing;Clouds;Humans;Planning;Robot sensing systems,actuators;cloud computing;cognitive systems;control engineering computing;humanoid robots;intelligent sensors,HRC;actuator;capital investment;cloud computing;cognitive component;cognitive faculties;computer;crowd-servicing;distributed computational resources;distributed sensing;electronic component;human physical component;human-robot cloud;intelligent sensor;intelligent system;physical world;robot network;sensor network technology;sensory faculties;situated collective intelligence;storage device;storage resources,,2,,40,,,27-31 May 2012,,IEEE,IEEE Conference Publications

This system consists of three layers, namely, a manufacturing device layer, cloud service system layer, and mobile service layer. The manufacturing device layer forms the production platform. This platform is composed of a number of physical devices, such as a flexible conveyor belt, industrial robots, and corresponding sensors. The physical devices are connected to the cloud via the support of a wireless module. In the cloud, the manufacturing big data are processed, and the optimization decision-making mechanism pertaining to customization manufacturing is formed.
