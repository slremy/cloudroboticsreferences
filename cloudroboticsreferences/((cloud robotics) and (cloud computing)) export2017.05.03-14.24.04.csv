The power of cloud computing may also be realized for mankind if some dedicated disaster management clouds will be developed at various countries cooperating each other on some common standards. The experimentation and deployment of cloud computing by governments of various countries for mankind may be the justified use of IT at social level. It is possible to realize a real-time disaster management cloud where applications in cloud will respond within a specified time frame. If a Real-Time Cloud (RTC) is available then for intelligent machines like robots the complex processing may be done on RTC via request and response model. The complex processing is more desirable as level of intelligence increases in robots towards humans even more. Therefore, it may be possible to manage disaster sites more efficiently with more intelligent cloud robots without great lose of human lives waiting for various assistance at disaster site.

This paper focuses on the IaaS aspects of robotic applications as cloud computing services.

By offloading heavy data- intensive computation to the ubiquitous cloud, quality of service (QoS) guarantee can be ensured. Unlike their mobile counterpart, the robots have unique characteristics of mobility, skill- learning, data collection and decision-making capabilities, which makes offloading decisions significantly complex. This paper proposes a generic cloud robotics framework to realize smart city vision while taking into consideration its various complexities. Specifically, task offloading is formulated as a constrained optimization problem capable of handling Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) known as task flow. Given the constraints, a genetic algorithm (GA) based scheme is further developed to solve the problem. The performance of the algorithm is verified by evaluating the results via three benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts of task offloading approach for smart city applications of cloud robotics.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1328-9; POD:978-1-5090-1329-6","10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841487","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841487","","Cloud computing;Genetic algorithms;Optimization;Robot sensing systems;Smart cities;Wireless sensor networks","cloud computing;control engineering computing;directed graphs;optimisation;quality of service;robots","DAG;Internet of Things;IoT;QoS;autonomous robotic agents;cloud computing;cloud robotics framework;constrained optimization problem;decision-making capabilities;direct acyclic graph;mobile counterpart;optimal task offloading;quality of service;smart city applications;ubiquitous cloud","","","","","","","4-8 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We introduce a novel training objective function that minimizes the uncertainties of the class labels and the grasp ground truths at the leaves of the forests, thereby enabling the framework to perform the recognition and grasp detection of objects. Our objective function is learned from features that are extracted from RGB-D point clouds of the objects.

The cloud computing framework cannot be directly mapped to cloud robotic systems with ad hoc networks since cloud robotic systems have additional constraints such as limited bandwidth and dynamic structure. However, most multirobotic applications with cooperative control adopt this decentralized approach to avoid a single point of failure. Robots need to continuously update intensive data to execute tasks in a coordinated manner, which implies real-time requirements. Thus, a resource allocation strategy is required, especially in such resource-constrained environments. This paper proposes a hierarchical auction-based mechanism, namely link quality matrix (LQM) auction, which is suitable for ad hoc networks by introducing a link quality indicator. The proposed algorithm produces a fast and robust method that is accurate and scalable. It reduces both global communication and unnecessary repeated computation. The proposed method is designed for firm real-time resource retrieval for physical multirobot systems. A joint surveillance scenario empirically validates the proposed mechanism by assessing several practical metrics. The results show that the proposed LQM auction outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for resource allocation.","2168-2267;21682267","","10.1109/TCYB.2016.2519525","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7403967","Cloud robotics;hierarchical auction;real-time resource allocation","Ad hoc networks;Cloud computing;Real-time systems;Resource management;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems","cloud computing;mobile robots;multi-robot systems;resource allocation","LQM auction;ad hoc networks;cloud computing framework;cloud robotic systems;cooperative control;dynamic structure;hierarchical auction-based mechanism;joint surveillance scenario;link quality indicator;link quality matrix;multirobotic applications;physical multirobot systems;real-time resource allocation;real-time resource retrieval;resource-constrained environments;robots","","2","","","","20160211","Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The proposed methodology is particularly suited if the fractal paradigm is applied to the factory seen as a complex system of systems but with relevant self-similarities across the several layers of components and structures from the shop-floor up to the enterprise level. A performance test has been conducted to demonstrate the viability of the technology for tiny embedded devices with the use of declarative embedded database language. Due to the high scalability of the algorithm and its simplicity, it seems suitable also for the robotic cloud paradigm, where constituent mechatronics, sensors and actuators components are provided as a service. The results provided suggests that, with the use of similar recursive and distributed form of computing, production bottlenecks or fault detection can be scaled to address the complex and pervasive cyber-physical systems problems that characterize the 4th industrial revolution strategies.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3474-1; POD:978-1-5090-3475-8","10.1109/IECON.2016.7793536","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7793536","Manufacturing automation;embedded systems;industrial cyberphysical systems;robotics","Fractals;Measurement;Production facilities;Robot sensing systems;Service robots","actuators;control engineering computing;cyber-physical systems;industrial robots;mechatronics","actuators components;automation components;bottleneck detection algorithm;complex cyber-physical system;declarative embedded database language;embedded devices;fault detection;fractal factory;industrial revolution strategies;lightweight embedded systems;mechatronics;performance test;pervasive cyber-physical system;production bottlenecks;robotic cloud;robotics;scalable production efficiency tool;sensors","","","","","","","23-26 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Fog and MEC computing can enable low latency services for many different scenarios by moving the cloud and some network functions closer to the user. In the case of mobile networks this improvement is traditionally introduced in the reference point that defines the limit of the operator domain. In this paper we explore the introduction of an intermediate component in the LTE standard architecture, describing its functionality and providing experimental results on its use. This component, called Fog Gateway, can process the data plane for specific services to prevent all the traffic reaching the core network. The gateway analyzes the GTP traffic inner destination IP in order to determine whether to route the packet to the fog network or forward it to the destination SGW. The solution is compliant with standard LTE equipment all along the path (UE, eNodeB, EPC), so it can be implemented in current networks, and the preliminary figures, obtained combining emulated and COTS equipment, show an improvement of up to the 78% in terms of latency reduction.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3651-6; POD:978-1-5090-3652-3","10.1109/FAS-W.2016.59","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789476","5G;Fog Computing;LTE;Low Latency;Mobile Edge Computing","Computer architecture;Delays;Long Term Evolution;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Proposals;Vehicles","5G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;cloud computing;internetworking","5G technology;COTS equipment;EPC;GTP traffic inner destination IP;LTE standard architecture;MEC computing;UE;augmented reality;data plane;destination SGW;eNodeB;fog computing;fog gateway;fog network;latency reduction;mobile networks;network function;remote robotics;standard LTE networks;ultralow-latency services;vehicle-to-vehicle communications","","","","","","","12-16 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Although it is regarded as a revolutionary paradigm in robotics, building a cloud robotic application is still a complex task today. Great efforts have to be made to develop the robotic-oriented cloud services, deploy them onto the cloud and integrating robotic software with them together. In this paper, we propose a cloud platform, micROS-cloud, which supports the direct deployment of Robot Operating System (ROS) software packages. The packages can be transformed into Internet-accessible services automatically. With the mechanisms named on-demand instantiation and container-based isolation, multiple robots can access such a cloud service simultaneously, even if the corresponding ROS package is originally designed just to serve a single robot. With micROS-cloud, general ROS applications can be easily migrated into the cloud robotic environment, and a lot of existing ROS packages in the robotic community can be transformed into o cloud services quickly.

Industrial networks currently provide deterministic services in robotic factories and aircraft, while the best effort Internet of Things provides best effort services for consumers. We argue that a convergence should occur, and that a future converged Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) should support both best effort and deterministic services, with very low latency and jitter. This article presents the design of a deterministic IIoT core network consisting of many simple deterministic packet switches configured by an SDN control plane. The use of deterministic communications can reduce router buffer sizes by a factor of ≥ 1000, and can reduce end-to-end latencies to the speed of light in fiber. A speed-of-light deterministic core network can have a profound impact on virtually all consumer services such as multimedia distribution, e-Commerce, and cloud computing or gaming systems. Highly aggregated video streams can be delivered over a deterministic virtual network with very high link utilization (≤ 100 percent), very low packet jitter (≤ 10 μs), and zero congestion. In addition to improving consumer services, a converged deterministic IIoT core network can save billions of dollars per year as a result of significantly improved network utilization and energy efficiency.","0163-6804;01636804","","10.1109/MCOM.2016.7498096","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498096","","Automation;IP networks;Internet;Internet of Things;Packet switching;Service robots;Streaming media","Internet;Internet of Things;customer services;packet switching;software defined networking;telecommunication network routing","SDN control plane;Tactile Internet;aircraft;cloud computing;consumer services;deterministic IIoT core network;deterministic communications;deterministic industrial internet core network;deterministic packet switches;deterministic virtual network;e-commerce;energy efficiency;gaming systems;industrial Internet of Things;link utilization;low packet jitter;multimedia distribution;network utilization;robotic factories;router buffer size reduction;software defined networking;speed-of-light deterministic core network;video streams;zero congestion","","1","","","","","June 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One challenge is that demonstrated trajectories may vary dramatically: it can be very difficult, if not impossible, for a system to learn control policies unless the trajectories are clustered into meaningful consistent subsets. Metric clustering methods, based on a distance measure, require quadratic time to compute a pairwise distance matrix and do not naturally distinguish topologically distinct trajectories. This paper presents an algorithm for topological clustering based on relative persistent homology, which, for a fixed underlying simplicial representation and discretization of trajectories, requires only linear time in the number of trajectories. The algorithm incorporates global constraints formalized in terms of the topology of sublevel or superlevel sets of a function and can be extended to incorporate probabilistic motion models. In experiments with real automobile and ship GPS trajectories as well as pedestrian trajectories extracted from video, the algorithm clusters trajectories into meaningful consistent subsets and, as we show in an experiment with ship trajectories, results in a faster and more efficient clustering than a metric clustering by Fréchet distance.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8026-3; POD:978-1-4673-8027-0","10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487092","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7487092","","Clustering algorithms;Global Positioning System;Measurement;Probabilistic logic;Robots;Topology;Trajectory","pattern clustering;probability;topology","global constraints;pedestrian trajectories;probabilistic motion models;relative persistent homology;ship GPS trajectories;topological trajectory clustering","","","","33","","","16-21 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Various techniques for remote control of ultrasound probes through telemanipulation systems have been presented in the past, however not exploiting the potential of fully autonomous acquisitions directly performed by robotic systems. In this paper, a trajectory planning algorithm for automatic robotic ultrasound acquisition under expert supervision is introduced. The objective is to compute a suitable path for covering a volume of interest selected in diagnostic images, for example by prior segmentation. A 3D patient surface point cloud is acquired using a depth camera, which is the sole prerequisite besides the volume delineation.

To facilitate a better understanding of the Tactile Internet, this article first elaborates on the commonalities and subtle differences between the Tactile Internet and the Internet of Things and 5G vision. After briefly reviewing its anticipated impact on society and infrastructure requirements, we then provide an up-to-date survey of recent progress and enabling technologies proposed for the Tactile Internet. Given that scaling up research in the area of future wired and wireless access networks will be essential for the Tactile Internet, we pay particular attention to the latency and reliability performance gains of fiber-wireless (FiWi) enhanced LTE-Advanced heterogeneous networks and their role for emerging cloudlets, mobile-edge computing, and cloud robotics.

SOAR features real-time debris detection and coverage-based rotation scheduling algorithms. The image processing algorithms for debris detection are specifically designed to address the unique challenges in aquatic environments. The rotation scheduling algorithm provides effective coverage for sporadic debris arrivals despite camera's limited angular view. Moreover, SOAR is able to dynamically offload compute-intensive processing tasks to the cloud for battery power conservation.

The approach is based on the analysis of discriminant features extracted from very easy to compute measures distributions. Over an offline learning phase, each piece of furniture is modeled according to their distributions of: height, color (H and S components) and normals. Then a sequence of distributions analysis are applied to the scene for selecting, according to learned models, the pieces of furniture with a high probability of being present. The point cloud is segmented according to model analysis and then segmented points are projected to the floor plane for clustering and noise removal. According to previous analysis and footprints of segmented points clouds, regions are then classified as a possible piece of furniture. Finally, the orientation and localization of the detected furnitures are obtained, using the footprint and their neighbor regions.

Of great interest is also to know how descriptors perform in object classification tasks. With that idea in mind, we introduce a descriptor designed for the representation of object classes. Our descriptor, named SCurV, exploits 3D shape information and is inspired by recent findings from neurophysiology. We compute and incorporate surface curvatures and distributions of local surface point projections that represent flatness, concavity and convexity in a 3D object-centered and view-dependent descriptor. These different sources of information are combined in a novel and simple, yet effective, way of combining different features to improve classification results which can be extended to the combination of any type of descriptor. Our experimental setup compares SCurV with other recent descriptors on a large classification task. Using a large and heterogeneous database of 3D objects, we perform our experiments both on a classical, flat classification task and within a novel framework for hierarchical classification.

The overall goal is to design robotic behaviors less boring and more effective and thus, to prepare robots for a long-term human-robot interaction.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7939-7; POD:978-1-4673-7940-3; USB:978-1-4673-7938-0","10.1109/INES.2015.7329648","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7329648","","Cloud computing;Educational robots;Human-robot interaction;Learning (artificial intelligence);Libraries","cloud computing;human-robot interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;telecontrol","autonomous robotic behavior;cloud computing;cloud-based agent;human operator;reinforcement learning;remote control;social human-robot interaction","","","","24","","","3-5 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present the design and implementation details of a novel cloud-based system architecture for robotic path planning. The proposed system, called Path Planning as a Service (PPaaS), is based on a three-layered architectural design: cloud server layer, cloud engine layer, and client robot layer. The cloud server layer is implemented with Hadoop Distributed File System. It contains a path plan database, which stores the solution paths that can be shared among robots. The cloud engine layer, which is the core of the architecture, utilizes Rapyuta cloud engine to create configurable containers for different robotic platforms. It also provides an on-demand path planning software in the cloud, which computes the optimal paths for robots to reach the goal positions. A load balancer is suggested to manage the container allocation in machines and coordinate local/cloud computation load balancing. The client robot layer is formed by a set of physical robots that employ PPaaS in the cloud. The communication framework of the entire system is based on Robot Operating System (ROS) platform, despite that robot clients do not necessarily run ROS.

Rapyuta helps robots to offload heavy computation by providing secured customizable computing environments in the cloud. The computing environments also allow the robots to easily access the RoboEarth knowledge repository. Furthermore, these computing environments are tightly interconnected, paving the way for deployment of robotic teams. We also describe three typical use cases, some benchmarking and performance results, and two proof-of-concept demonstrations. Note to Practitioners - Rapyuta allows to outsource some or all of a robot's onboard computational processes to a commercial data center. Its main difference to other, similar frameworks like the Google App Engine is that it is specifically tailored towards multiprocess high-bandwidth robotics applications/middlewares and provides a well-documented open-source implementation that can be modified to cover a large variety of robotic scenarios. Rapyuta supports the outsourcing of almost all of the current 3000+ ROS packages out of the box and is easily extensible to other robotic middleware. A pre-installed Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is provided that allows to launch Rapyuta in any of Amazon's data center within minutes. Once launched, robots can authenticate themselves to Rapyuta, create one or more secured computational environments in the cloud and launch the desired nodes/processes. The computing environments can also be arbitrarily connected to build parallel computing architectures on the fly. The WebSocket-based communication protocol, which provides synchronous and asynchronous communication mechanisms, allows not only ROS based robots, but also browsers and mobiles phones to connect to the ecosystem. Rapyuta's computing environments are private, secure, and optimized for data throughput. However, its performance is in large part determined by the latency and quality of the network connection - nd the performance of the data center. Optimizing performance under these constraints is typically highly application-specific. The paper illustrates an example of performance optimization in a collaborative real-time 3-D mapping application. Other target applications include collaborative 3-D mapping, task/grasp planning, object recognition, localization, and teleoperation, among others.","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2014.2329556","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6853392","Cloud robotics;cloud-based mapping;networked robots;platform-as-a-service (PaaS)","Cloud computing;Containers;Data structures;Open source software;Protocols;Robots","cloud computing;middleware;parallel processing;programming environments;public domain software;robot programming;software packages","AMI;Amazon Machine Image;Amazon data center;Google App Engine;ROS based robots;ROS packages outsourcing;Rapyuta;RoboEarth knowledge repository;WebSocket-based communication protocol;asynchronous communication mechanisms;benchmarking;browsers;collaborative real-time 3D mapping application;commercial data center;data throughput;ecosystem;mobiles phones;multiprocess high-bandwidth robotics;network connection latency;network connection quality;object recognition;open-source cloud robotics platform;parallel computing architectures;performance optimization;proof-of-concept demonstrations;robot onboard computational processes;robotic middleware;robotic teams deployment;secured customizable computing environments;task/grasp planning;use cases","","20","","37","","20140711","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Mental models allow us to imagine how something may be, only by its description. This video presents a use-case demonstration of a high-dimensional geometrical system for acquiring mental models for robots, called Robot Imagination System (RIS). RIS generates models of objects based on their descriptive words, even prior to their perception. This is achieved by using an inference algorithm that computes the fusion of features corresponding to descriptive words, allowing to imagine an object whose description has never been presented before. As shown in the video, there is a previous training process where visual data is combined with semantic information. Each keyword creates an n-dimensional instance of the object in the feature space. Feature inference is treated as the intersection of hyperplanes generated from the keywords in the feature space. These hyperplanes extend the meaning of keywords. With a previous basic algorithm, we explored the basis for robotic imagination through mental models. Now, the extended algorithm allows context detection by introducing a previous clustering step combined with cluster bigram co-occurrences, and an analysis of keyword point cloud principal components.

The projected costs for tape-drives, robotics, and maintenance, are creating challenges for tape-based archives. The advent of erasure-coded object storage, driven by the ""cloud storage"" industry, might make it practical to implement archives using disks, or hybrid disk-and-tape systems. We used linear optimization techniques to investigate when and how this transition might best be made, taking into consideration our significant investment in tape technology.

Its generalization for articulated structures, although possible through a joint optimization of all pose parameters, is challenging as it is necessary to solve a non-closed form. It also suffers heavily from the local minima problem. A number of proposed Articulated ICP (AICP) algorithms circumvent the problem of the non-closed form solution and offer an efficient alternative. However, they still exhibit an increased tendency, caused by the local minima, to converge to an incorrect pose. Typically, the above problem manifests itself after a transient disturbance in the convergence, such as an occlusion which causes an increase in the point-to-point association distances between the model and the data. In this paper, we propose an extension to the AICP algorithm that benefits from the efficiency of ICP as well as avoids its problems by using global pose optimization elements to guide the convergence process to the correct pose. The proposed approach is to merge adaptively the joint adjustments computed by AICP with the adjustments needed for a number of key points to reach their respective target positions, identified by a local feature descriptor search. Experiments show that the proposed Global-Local Articulated ICP algorithm exhibits improved robustness to transient disturbances, like occlusions, in comparison with the AICP algorithm.","1062-922X;1062922X","Electronic:978-1-4799-3840-7; POD:978-1-4799-3841-4; USB:978-1-4799-3839-1","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974309","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974309","Articulated ICP;Human pose tracking;ICP;RBG_D;global pose optimization;point cloud data;service robotics","Biological system modeling;Convergence;Iterative closest point algorithm;Joints;Kinematics;Optimization;Three-dimensional displays","computer vision;iterative methods;minimisation;object tracking;pose estimation;robots","GLAICP;computer vision;convergence process;depth data;global pose optimization element;global-local articulated ICP algorithm;global-local optimization algorithm;iterative closest point algorithm;local feature descriptor search;occlusion;point cloud data sets;point-to-point association distance;robotics;robust human pose tracking","","0","","16","","","5-8 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm approximates a scene using an adjacency-graph of spatially connected surface patches. Edges in the graph are then classified as either convex or concave using a novel, strictly local criterion. Region growing is employed to identify locally convex connected subgraphs, which represent the object parts. We show quantitatively that our algorithm, although conceptually easy to graph and fast to compute, produces results that are comparable to far more complex state-of-the-art methods which use classification, learning and model fitting. This suggests that convexity/concavity is a powerful feature for object partitioning using 3D data.

Combining two frames is the key step to construct a complete 3D map, and the relative pose between two views w.r.t two frames is needed. 3D point pairs are necessary for computing 6DOF pose transformation. In this paper, a method for finding correspondences of two point clouds is proposed, and the advantages of depth camera are taken fully. The idea of this approach comes from the fact that people pay more attentions to some key points when they watch an environment. Point pairs are generated from just points around the feature points, and these pairs are corresponded accurately and the number of pairs is sufficient to compute relative pose. Firstly, the algorithm for matching features from intensity image is proposed. Secondly, 3D point pairs are obtained according to the feature positions. Lastly, two point clouds are registered based on the relative pose computed.

The requirements for mobile robotics are different and include support for real-time processing, incremental update, localization, mapping, path planning, obstacle avoidance, ray-tracing, terrain traversability assessment, grasping/manipulation and visualization for effective human-robot interaction. We carry out a quantitative comparison of Greedy Projection and Marching cubes along with our voxel planes method. The execution speed, error, compression and visualization appearance of these are assessed. Our voxel planes approach first computes the PCA over the points inside a voxel, combining these PCA results across 2×2×2 voxel neighborhoods in a sliding window. Second, the smallest eigenvector and voxel centroid define a plane which is intersected with the voxel to reconstruct the surface patch (3-6 sided convex polygon) within that voxel. By nature of their construction these surface patches tessellate to produce a surface representation of the underlying points. In experiments on public datasets the voxel planes method is 3 times faster than marching cubes, offers 300 times better compression than Greedy Projection, 10 fold lower error than marching cubes whilst allowing incremental map updates.","2153-0858;21530858","DVD:978-1-4673-6357-0; Electronic:978-1-4673-6358-7; POD:978-1-4673-6356-3","10.1109/IROS.2013.6696889","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6696889","","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Image reconstruction;Principal component analysis;Robot sensing systems;Surface reconstruction","collision avoidance;computational geometry;data visualisation;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;image colour analysis;mobile robots;principal component analysis;ray tracing;real-time systems;surface reconstruction","2×2×2 voxel neighborhoods;PCA;RGB-D image sensors;computer graphics community;convex polygon;eigenvector;grasping;greedy projection;human-robot interaction;incremental map updates;incremental update;localization;manipulation;mapping;marching cubes;meshification;mobile robotics perception processing pipeline;obstacle avoidance;path planning;point cloud ensembles;public datasets;rapid visualization;ray-tracing;real-time processing;reconstruct the surface patch;sliding window;surface patches;surface reconstructions;surface representation;tabletop scanners;terrain traversability assessment;unorganized point clouds;visualization appearance;voxel centroid;voxel planes method","","1","","23","","","3-7 Nov. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The space of rotations is searched with a particle filter and scoring is performed by looking for clusters in the resulting sets of translations. We use features computed from homogeneous triangle meshes and point clouds that require low computation time. A major advantage of the approach proves to be the possible consideration of prior knowledge about the relative orientation.

We question this design practice as we expect a significant functional volume reduction for performing certain activities vs. the maximum obtainable workspace. To this end, we compare and contrast four anatomically-accurate thumb models. We quantify their angular ranges of motion by generating point clouds of end-effector positions, and by computing their alpha-shape bounded volumes.

In spatial augmented reality, a projector renders virtual objects onto 3D objects in the real space. To watch the augmented virtual objects from a viewpoint without distortions, the final image should be pre-distorted based on the geometry information of the 3D objects in the real world. In our RSAR setting, we assume that a robot is equipped with the devices such as a projector, low-cost depth cameras, and the sensor of capturing 3D position of the viewpoint. The robot captures the 3D environment with as a point cloud and reconstructs the geometry of 3D objects in the real world with a set of planes. In order that the viewer can see the distortion-free virtual objects, we compute the pre-warped images of virtual objects for a projector.

These sensors use CMOS imaging chips with electronic rolling shutters (ERS). When using such a sensor on a moving platform, both the image, and the depth map, will exhibit geometric distortions. We introduce an algorithm that can suppress such distortions, by rectifying the 3D point clouds from the range sensor. This is done by first estimating the time continuous 3D camera trajectory, and then transforming the 3D points to where they would have been, if the camera had been stationary. To ensure that image and range data are synchronous, the camera trajectory is computed from KLT tracks on the structured-light frames, after suppressing the structured-light pattern. We evaluate our rectification, by measuring angles between the visible sides of a cube, before and after rectification. We also measure how much better the 3D point clouds can be aligned after rectification.

The ASRVN is an operational data collection and processing system. It receives 50 times 50 km<sup>2</sup> subsets of MODIS level 1B (L1B) data from MODIS adaptive processing system and AERONET aerosol and water-vapor information. Then, it performs an atmospheric correction (AC) for about 100 AERONET sites based on accurate radiative-transfer theory with complex quality control of the input data. The ASRVN processing software consists of an L1B data gridding algorithm, a new cloud-mask (CM) algorithm based on a time-series analysis, and an AC algorithm using ancillary AERONET aerosol and water-vapor data. The AC is achieved by fitting the MODIS top-of-atmosphere measurements, accumulated for a 16-day interval, with theoretical reflectance parameterized in terms of the coefficients of the Li Sparse-Ross Thick (LSRT) model of the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). The ASRVN takes several steps to ensure high quality of results: 1) the filtering of opaque clouds by a CM algorithm; 2) the development of an aerosol filter to filter residual semitransparent and subpixel clouds, as well as cases with high inhomogeneity of aerosols in the processing area; 3) imposing the requirement of the consistency of the new solution with previously retrieved BRF and albedo; 4) rapid adjustment of the 16-day retrieval to the surface changes using the last day of measurements; and 5) development of a seasonal backup spectral BRF database to increase data coverage. The ASRVN provides a gapless or near-gapless coverage for the processing area. The gaps, caused by clouds, are filled most naturally with the latest solution for a given pixel. The ASRVN products include three parameters of the LSRT model (k<sup>L</sup>, k<sup- - >G</sup>, and k<sup>V</sup>), surface albedo, normalized BRF (computed for a standard viewing geometry, VZA = 0deg, SZA = 45deg), and instantaneous BRF (or one-angle BRF value derived from the last day of MODIS measurement for specific viewing geometry) for the MODIS 500-m bands 1-7. The results are produced daily at a resolution of 1 km in gridded format. We also provide a cloud mask, a quality flag, and a browse bitmap image. The ASRVN data set, including 6 years of MODIS TERRA and 1.5 years of MODIS AQUA data, is available now as a standard MODIS product (MODASRVN) which can be accessed through the Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System website ((http://ladsweb.nascom.nasa.gov/data/search.html).).

The model is built through a series of geometrical reasoning steps, namely: planar segmentation, cuboid decomposition, fixture recognition and interpretation (e.g. handles and knobs), and object classification based on object state information.","2153-0858;21530858","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-2058-2; POD:978-1-4244-2057-5","10.1109/IROS.2008.4650972","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4650972","","Floors;Logic gates;Manipulators;Meteorology;Robot kinematics;Robots;Three dimensional displays","computational geometry;image classification;image segmentation;robot vision","3D functional object maps;3D point cloud data;cuboid decomposition;fixture interpretation;fixture recognition;geometrical reasoning;household robotic assistant;indoor household environments;kitchen environments;object classification;object state information;planar segmentation","","8","","15","","","22-26 Sept. 2008","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Fast Detection of Polygons in 3D Point Clouds from Noise-Prone Range Sensors","N. Vaskevicius; A. Birk; K. Pathak; J. Poppinga","School of Engineering and Science, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), Jacobs University Bremen, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany, http://robotics.jacobs-university.de","2007 IEEE International Workshop on Safety, Security and Rescue Robotics","20071112","2007","","","1","6","3D sensing and modeling is increasingly important for mobile robotics in general and safety, security and rescue robotics (SSRR) in particular. To reduce the data and to allow for efficient processing, e.g., with computational geometry algorithms, it is necessary to extract surface data from 3D point clouds delivered by range sensors. A significant amount of work on this topic exists from the computer graphics community. But the existing work relies on relatively exact point cloud data. As also shown by others, sensors suited for mobile robots are very noise-prone and standard approaches that use local processing on surface normals are doomed to fail. Hence plane fitting has been suggested as solution by the robotics community. Here, a novel approach for this problem is presented. Its main feature is that it is based on region growing and that the underlying mathematics has been re-formulated such that an incremental fit can be done, i.e., the best fit surface does not have to be completely re-computed the moment a new point is investigated in the region growing process. The worst case complexity is O(n log(n)), but as shown in experiments it tends to scale linearly with typical data. Results with real world data from a Swissranger time-of-flight camera are presented where surface polygons are always successfully extracted within about 0.3 sec.","2374-3247;23743247","CD-ROM:978-1-4244-1569-4; POD:978-1-4244-1568-7","10.1109/SSRR.2007.4381261","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4381261","3D Map;Point Cloud;Range Sensor;Surface Model","Clouds;Computational geometry;Computer graphics;Data mining;Data security;Mathematics;Mobile robots;Robot sensing systems;Safety;Surface fitting","computational geometry;mobile robots;robot vision;stereo image processing;surface fitting","3D point clouds;3D sensing;computational geometry algorithm;data processing;data reduction;incremental fit;mobile robotics;noise-prone range sensors;plane fitting;polygon detection;region growing;rescue robotics;safety robotics;security robotics;stereo vision;surface data extraction;surface normals;surface polygons;worst case complexity","","4","1","17","","","27-29 Sept. 2007","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"
"Inversion of Atmospheric Parameters from Sky Radiance Measurements with a Sun Photometer","C. Borel","Ball Aerosp. & Technol. Corp, Fairborn, OH","2006 IEEE International Symposium on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","20070618","2006","","","585","588","NASA has organized a worldwide Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) of Sun photometers. These well characterized instruments (CIMEL Sun photometer) make aerosol optical depth measurements based on the transmission of the direct sunlight through the atmosphere in 5 and 8 spectral bands. AERONET aerosol retrievals are limited to clear sky conditions (no clouds or no cirrus clouds) and retrieve aerosol optical depth. To retrieve other parameters such as aerosol size distribution, single scattering albedo, refractive index, etc., retrievals based on algorithms from Nakajima [2] and Dubovik [1] are used. Since the algorithms are limited to clear sky conditions and not available to the public, we decided to write our own retrieval algorithm which uses the solar principal plane and almucantar scans from the CIMEL instrument. We studied a variety of radiative transfer methods that are able to simulate ground measurements by computing the hemispherical sky radiance. For various reasons we decided to use the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) code [4,5] and combined it with IDL's Amoeba (down-hill simplex method) [3] to retrieve five parameters: (1) water cloud optical depth, (2) ice cloud optical depth, (3) cloud water droplet radius, (4) horizontal visibility (related to aerosol optical depth), and (5) RH factor which couples relative humidity and aerosol size distribution, from principal plane and almucantar scans. The SBDART computed sky radiances are very close to the measured sky radiances 40 degrees away from the solar aureole since the Discrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer (DISORT) algorithm [6] is not accurate in the forward scattering direction. In this paper we will show results of the inversion of AERONET data using SBDART.","2153-6996;21536996","POD:0-7803-9510-7","10.1109/IGARSS.2006.154","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4241301","","Aerosols;Atmospheric measurements;Clouds;Instruments;NASA;Optical refraction;Optical scattering;Optical variables control;Photometry;Sun","aerosols;atmospheric humidity;atmospheric radiation;clouds;ice;radiative transfer;sunlight","AERONET;Aerosol Robotic Network;CIMEL instrument;DISORT algorithm;Discrete Ordinates Radiative Transfer;SBDART;Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer;Sun Photometer;aerosol optical depth measurements;aerosol retrievals;aerosol size distribution;almucantar scans;cloud water droplet radius;ice cloud optical depth;radiative transfer methods;refractive index;relative humidity;single scattering albedo;sky radiance measurements;solar aureole;solar principal plane;sunlight transmission;water cloud optical depth","","0","","6","","","July 31 2006-Aug. 4 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The term “Singularity” is used to describe a hypothetical punctuation point sometime in the future where Artificial Intelligence (AI) will surpass human intelligence. The concept has been popularized by science fiction author Vernor Vinge and Ray Kurzweil. “Superintelligence,” a 2014 book by Nick Bostrom, explores a similar theme. Recently, Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, and Bill Gates publicly expressed fears about the dangers of post-Singularity AI and robotics. Here, it is suggested that ""Singularity"" is distracting attention from a far more realistic and important development that we might call “Multiplicity.” Multiplicity characterizes an emerging category of systems where diverse groups of humans work together with diverse groups of machines to solve difficult problems. Multiplicity combines the wisdom of crowds with the power of cloud computing.","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2015.2408458","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7057690","","Artificial intelligence","","","","0","","","","20150310","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

"What Is Automation?","K. Goldberg","College of Engineering and School of Information, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA","IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","20111226","2012","9","1","1","2","It is argued that automation has expanded beyond its roots in Manufacturing to include applications in Healthcare, Security, Transportation, Agriculture, Construction, Energy, and many other areas. Both Robotics and Automation explore the frontiers of automated and semi-automated machines. Both fields are increasingly concerned with the role of humans and human interfaces, and with the potential of the Internet and Cloud Computing. So what is the difference between Robotics and Automation? There are many possible distinctions. Here is the summary from our Society's Field of Interest Statement: ""...Robotics focuses on systems incorporating sensors and actuators that operate autonomously or semi-autonomously in cooperation with humans. Robotics research emphasizes intelligence and adaptability to cope with unstructured environments. Automation research emphasizes efficiency, productivity, quality, and reliability, focusing on systems that operate autonomously, often in structured environments over extended periods, and on the explicit structuring of such environments."" This statement emphasizes how Automation emphasizes structured versus unstructured environments, reliability versus adaptability, and efficiency versus exploratory operations. These are valuable distinctions and the author would like to propose another one. In his view, research in Robotics emphasizes Feasibility. Feasibility focuses on proof-of-concept, demonstrating how a new functionality can be achieved. On the other hand, he feels, research in Automation emphasizes Quality. The author wishes to dispel the myth of the excluded middle: Robotics and Automation are not disjoint. Feasibility and Quality are closely related.","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2011.2178910","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6104197","","","","","","2","","","","20111213","Jan. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Guan","Arizona State University, U.S.A","2016 IEEE Information Technology, Networking, Electronic and Automation Control Conference","20160905","2016","","","1","7","Service-oriented computing and service-level orchestration through visual or graphical programming have been widely used in software and particularly in Web application development. Their further developments and fusing into Internet of Things, Robot as a Service (RaaS), cloud computing, and big data analysis have created the infrastructure for the information technologies to penetrate into all sectors of industry, service, and society. Figure 1 shows the stack of the related concepts, technologies, and applications. IoT service orchestration and visual programming separates the high-level composition from the low-level device programming, which allows the application builders to focus on the business logic, while the service providers to focus on efficient service development. This presentation will discuss the current service orchestration and visual programming environments for IoT application development. The presentation centralizes the topics around IoT. It starts with the upper layer of IoT, including service-oriented computing, Web software development, and service orchestration for system integration, which forms the foundation of cloud computing and a major data source of big data analysis. On the other hand, IoT standards and protocols are presented, which connect the service orchestration infrastructure tohardware and devices. As IoT applications and implementations, ADS (Autonomous Decentralized Systems), DPWS (Device Profile for Web Services), and Robot as a Service will be discussed. Different orchestration environments that have been widely used in industry and academic world will be presented, including BPEL in Oracle SOA Suite, Microsoft Workflow Foundation, Intel IoT Service Orchestration Layer, Microsoft Robotics Development Studio, MIT App Inventor, CMU Alice visual game programming environment, and ASU VIPLE (Visual IoT/Robotics Programming Environment). As a case study, VIPLE will be presented in more detail. VIPLE is a free software with ope- source IoT middleware developed at Arizona State University. VIPLE orchestration environment has an open interface to IoT devices. Any IoT device that can be programmed to interpret JSON objects and wrap sensory data into JSON objects can interface with VIPLE and be programmed using VIPLE orchestration environment. A demonstration will be given to show how an IoT application can be developed in minutes to control Intel Edison IoT device.

This paper proposes a multiple motion controlling mechanism of a robotic car using Raspberry Pi which works as master and Arduino UNO which works as slave. Each device is uniquely identifiable by the controlling software which is the core concept of IoT. Client manages the activities of the car from remote or distant places over the internet by voice commands and Universal Windows Application and also able to get data and feedback. The main contribution of this paper is that it leverages the efficiency of robot's motion controlling system because robotic car can receive direct commands at a time from multiple sources which make the maneuvering system more efficient. Both device and client do not need to be online at the same time. Commands and data are stored in cloud service which delivers them when the device is ready to receive. A GPS system is incorporated thus clients can trace the car. The system has ultrasonic distance sensor for avoiding obstacles coming in between its path. We present the architecture and design of the Raspberry Pi and Arduino communication software and illustrate how to control the car by means of commands and application.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5627-9; POD:978-1-5090-5628-6","10.1109/ECACE.2017.7913002","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7913002","Arduino;GPS;IoT;Raspberry Pi;Ultrasonic distance sensor;cloud service;motion control","Automobiles;Cloud computing;Control systems;Global Positioning System;Robot sensing systems;Wireless communication","","","","","","","","","16-18 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

An algorithm is proposed for enrichment of the reconstructed map, and furthermore, a Kalman Filter is used for sensor fusion. The scaling factor of the monocular slam is calculated by the linear fitting. Moreover, a PID controller is designed for 3D position control. Finally, by means of the potential field method and Rapidly exploring Random Tree (RRT) path planning algorithm, a collision-free road map is generated.

In this system, haptic rendering is accomplished using streaming point cloud data of Kinect. A preprocessing phase including downsampling and noise reduction is applied to the raw point clouds to prevent huge computation load. In preprocessing phase, it should be concerned that the density of points firmly threats the proxy situation to be in popthrough. Furthermore, the contact is detected by a proxy based algorithm and using a kd-tree search to find contact point among lots of points derived from Kinect. Force can be computed by using a virtual spring coupling between HIP and proxy. The noise is reduced in first phase to reduce the next errors in force calculation. This feature helps us to have a stable system in contact with a dynamic environment including movement and new objects.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3222-8; POD:978-1-5090-3223-5","10.1109/ICRoM.2016.7886807","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886807","downsampling;dynamic environment;fast contact detection;haptic;point clouds","Haptic interfaces;Hip;Noise reduction;Real-time systems;Rendering (computer graphics);Robot sensing systems;Three-dimensional displays","computational geometry;haptic interfaces;noise;rendering (computer graphics);signal processing;tree searching","downsampling;fast contact detection;haptic rendering;haptic system;kd-tree search;noise reduction;point cloud data streaming;preprocessing phase","","","","","","","26-28 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The application server program cuts these data into segments of 128 samples with 50% overlap. And each segment is embedded into a 6-dimensional pseudo phase space, then a geometric template matching algorithm is applied to classify them into different actions.

This opens up the usability for these data, called point clouds, in areas such as robotics, telemedicine, and entertainment. However, a primary issue is the data rate of point clouds being produced by sensors such as the Microsoft Kinect. When transmitted, the size of a single point cloud coupled with the high frame rate results in an impractical bandwidth requirement. Therefore, compression is required. However, current compression techniques offered by the Point Cloud Library (PCL) are static in terms of available network bandwidth, meaning the techniques do not adjust as the network changes. In this paper, we propose using a dynamic compression technique that adjusts the compression ratio in response to the network throughput. Experimental results under both static and dynamic network traffic conditions show that dynamic compression is promising in achieving higher and smoother frame rates compared with the built-in compression algorithm in PCL.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4588-4; POD:978-1-5090-4589-1","10.1109/ICCNC.2017.7876188","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7876188","Kinect;compression;point cloud;real-time;video transmission","Filtering;Octrees;Real-time systems;Sensors;Streaming media;Three-dimensional displays;Throughput","data compression;image sensors;telecommunication traffic;video coding;video communication;video streaming","3D sensors;3D spatial data;Kinect-based point cloud data streaming;Microsoft Kinect;PCL;data usability;dynamic compression technique;dynamic network traffic conditions;network bandwidth;point cloud library;static network traffic conditions;video transmission","","","","","","","26-29 Jan. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The availability of mobile devices equipped with depth sensors compels the developed applications to be both memory and computationally efficient. Toward this, in this letter, we present 3DHoPD, a new low-dimensional 3-D feature descriptor that is extremely fast to compute. The novelty lies in compactly encoding the “3-D” keypoint position by transforming it to a new 3-D space, where the keypoints arising from similar 3-D surface patches lie close to each other. Then, we propose histograms of point distributions (HoPD) to capture the neighborhood structure, thus forming 3DHoPD (3D+HoPD). We propose a tailored feature descriptor matching technique, wherein the “3-D” keypoint position in the new 3-D space is used to remove false positive matches, effectively reducing the search space by 90%, and then, the exact match is found using the “HoPD” descriptor. Experimental evaluation on multiple publicly available datasets shows that 3DHoPD is robust to noise and offers stable and competitive keypoint matching performance to the existing state-of-the-art 3-D descriptors with similar dimensionality across datasets, while requiring dramatically low-computational time (10× faster).

Steel bridges have been traditionally constructed by securing plate members together with rivets. However, rivets present a challenge for robots both in terms of cleaning and surface traversal. This paper presents a novel approach to RGB-D image and point cloud analysis that enables rivets to be rapidly and robustly located using low cost, non-contact sensing devices that can be easily affixed to a robot. The approach performs classification based on: (a) high-intensity blobs in color images, (b) the non-linear perturbations in depth images, and (c) surface normal clusters in 3D point clouds. The predicted rivet locations from the three classifiers are combined using a probabilistic occupancy mapping technique. Experiments are conducted in several different lab and real-world steel bridge environments, where there is no external lighting infrastructure, and the sensors are attached to a mobile platform, i.e. a climbing inspection robot. The location of rivets within 2m of the robot can be robustly located within 10mm of their correct location.

Meanwhile, a hierarchical parallel computing architecture is also proposed to maximize the usage of both CPU and GPU. The adaptivity of the seed-and-expand scheme is pushed further by processing a pixel several rounds while, in order to maintain regularity for GPU implementation, every seed has exactly the same behavior in a single round of optimization. The high adaptivity also improves the robustness of the proposed method, thus aggressive matching score and a view selection method can be used to improve the reconstruction completeness extensively, without smearing out local details and lowering the accuracy. Compared with the state of the art, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and completeness on standard datasets. The proposed method is also very fast.

Due to the limitations of its local resources, the capability of a single robot is usually severely restricted. Cloud robotics has been recently proposed to extend the capability of robots by leveraging the rich services provided in cloud. However, robotic applications generally give considerable attention to quality of service (QoS) because these applications interact directly with the physical world. Fulfilling strict QoS requirements while utilizing cloud services, the performance of which is highly unpredictable, is a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid architecture for cloud robotics, named RoboCloud, to address this challenge. Instead of simply integrating robots with public cloud services, RoboCloud introduces a task-specified mission cloud with controllable resources, predictable behavior. The mission cloud can extend the capability of the robot on its specified, predictable tasks without sacrificing QoS. For general tasks beyond the capability of the mission cloud, we opt for public clouds, i.e., various cloud services available on the Internet. We successfully apply this architecture to realize robotic object recognition, which is a fundamental capability of autonomous robots who interact with an open environment. We can minimize the recognition latency of objects that are predicted to appear in a specific task without sacrificing the capability to recognize unfamiliar, unexpected objects by seamlessly integrating a specialized mission cloud, a public object recognition service on the Internet.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2771-2; POD:978-1-5090-2772-9","10.1109/UIC-ATC-ScalCom-CBDCom-IoP-SmartWorld.2016.0028","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7816824","cloud robotics;mission cloud;mobile cloud computing;object recognition;public cloud","Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Object recognition;Quality of service;Robot kinematics","cloud computing;control engineering computing;object recognition;quality of service;robot programming;robot vision;task analysis","Internet;QoS-aware cloud robotic applications;autonomous robots;critical tasks;hybrid architecture;public object recognition service;quality of service;specialized mission cloud","","","","","","","18-21 July 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Energy aware SLAs extend the existing SLA agreements in order to include energy and carbon aware parameters. The efficiency and availability of the system are not disturbed when certain jobs are relaxed in order to obtain high energy consumption. In order to increase the energy consumption further we incorporated the concept of cloud federations in which a group of CSPs, mutually agree to make use of their resources to execute the VMs of other CSPs. An algorithm based on the amount of energy consumed by different CSPs is being readily implemented. This algorithm grant a group of CSPs to jointly set the federations in a manner to distribute their work equally so as to reduce the energy consumed. The results from the above approach show that it can be considered as a hopeful solution to the problem of reducing the energy cost even though there are a few challenges during implementation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1623-5; POD:978-1-5090-1624-2","10.1109/DISCOVER.2016.7806217","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7806217","Cloud Computing;Cloud Federation;Energy Aware SLA;Service Level Agreements","Carbon dioxide;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Electronic mail;Energy consumption;Green products;Organizations","cloud computing;contracts;energy conservation;power aware computing;virtual machines","CSP;VM;cloud computing;cloud service providers;energy aware SLA;energy consumption reduction;energy cost reduction;green cloud federations;service level agreements","","","","","","","13-14 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The purpose of collecting this data and processing it in a meaningful manner requires that it adds significant value to the end user. WSN are deployed ever more frequently and applications vary from providing an early alert system on the activity of a volcano, to controlling the movements of livestock so that farming output can be maximized using virtual fencing. There are many challenges facing wireless sensor networks, with one being found in the uniqueness of each application, and challenges arise when WSN developers try to adequately test such applications when they are deployed with varying numbers of nodes, in all ranges of environmental conditions. To implement such systems in hardware involves a huge financial investment and from a development perspective prevents the developer from changing hardware platforms or communications protocols throughout the testing phase without incurring further financial hardship. Due to this fact, tools which can accurately simulate the behavior and performance of real world WSN applications are in high demand and a crucial aspect in the continued growth of WSN in the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper presents a cloud based system which makes various simulation platforms available to multiple users who wish to test WSN routing protocols or the hardware constraints of the various WSN platforms. This simulation testbed is hosted on a Dell PowerEdge R720 server in the communications laboratory in the University of Limerick and it is made available to users through the use of a virtual machine. This offers users access to many of the popular WSN simulation environments with vast computing resources and storage but at far reduced costs for protocol simulation.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-0796-7; POD:978-1-5090-0797-4","10.1109/ICSensT.2016.7796270","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7796270","WSN;cloud;simulation;testbed;virtual machine","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Hardware;Protocols;Servers;Wireless sensor networks","Internet;Internet of Things;cloud computing;routing protocols;wireless sensor networks","Dell PowerEdge R720 server;Internet of Things;IoT;University of Limerick;WSN;WSN simulation tool;cloud based environment;communications protocol;cost reduction;data collection;farming;financial investment;livestock;routing protocol;sensor node collection;virtual fencing;virtual machine;wireless sensor network","","","","","","","11-13 Nov. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

When the point clouds are captured from different kinds of sensors, there are large and different kinds of variations. In this study, we address an even more challenging case in which the differently-source point clouds are acquired from a real street view. One is produced directly by the LiDAR system and the other is generated by using VSFM software on image sequence captured from RGB cameras. When it confronts to large scale point clouds, previous methods mostly focus on point-to-point level registration, and the methods have many limitations.The reason is that the least mean error strategy shows poor ability in registering large variable cross-source point clouds. In this paper, different from previous ICP-based methods, and from a statistic view, we propose a effective coarse-to-fine algorithm to detect and register a small scale SFM point cloud in a large scale Lidar point cloud.

Base on the information received by the kinect sensor, the mobile robot can choose different avoidance strategy when facing different kinds of obstacles intelligently. First, we get a 3D point cloud from the depth image and compute the height of each point from ground plane which is estimated during a calibration step. In this step, we can discriminate which point belongs to obstacles. Then we use a batch of depth images to get the dynamic objects of each image. Finally, the obstacle map is an orthographic projection of these obstacle points along the normal to the ground plane.

In this context, stigmergy is a widely employed approach to robotic coordination based on the idea of interacting with the environment by means of markers called pheromones. Pheromones do not need to be ""physical marks"", and a number of works have investigated the use of digital, virtual pheromones. In this paper, we show how the concept of virtual pheromones can be implemented in Jason, a Java-based interpreter for an extended version of AgentSpeak, providing a high-level modelling and execution environment for multi-agent systems. We also exploit MQTT, a messaging infrastructure for the Internet-of-Things. This allows the implementation of stigmergic algorithms in a high-level declarative language, building on top of low-level infrastructures typically used only for controlling sensors and actuators.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-5093-2; POD:978-1-5090-5094-9","10.1109/CloudNet.2016.22","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7776601","cloud robotics;multi-agent systems;stigmergy","Cloud computing;Multi-agent systems;Planning;Quality of service;Robot kinematics;Sensors","Internet of Things;Java;multi-robot systems;program interpreters","AgentSpeak;BDI robots;Internet-of-Things;Jason;Java-based interpreter;MQTT;actuator control;digital-virtual pheromone implementation;execution environment;high-level declarative language;high-level modelling;low-level infrastructures;messaging infrastructure;multiagent systems;pheromone markers;physical marks;resource constraints;robotic coordination;sensor control;stigmergic algorithms;swarm robotics","","","","","","","3-5 Oct. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The second is that even if their software is open source, low-cost robots usually lack sufficient resources such as CPU power or memory capabilities, thus forbidding advanced algorithms to be executed in-robot. Within the context of RAPP (Robotic Applications for Delivering Smart User Empowering Applications) we treat robots as platforms, where applications can be downloaded and automatically deployed.

The challenge here is to have a signal and detection system that works from long range (> 1000m) amongst ground clutter during various seasonal conditions on passive imagery. We use a smoke-grenade as a ground signal, which has the advantageous properties of being easy to carry by ground crews because of its light weight and small size, but when released has a long visual signaling range. We employ a camera system on the UAV with a visual texture feature extraction approach in a machine learning framework to classify image patches as `signal' or `background'. We study conventional approaches and develop a visual feature descriptor that can better differentiate the appearance of the visual signal under varying conditions and, when used to train a random-forest classifier, outperforms commonly used feature descriptors. The system was rigorously and quantitatively evaluated on data collected from a camera mounted on a helicopter and flown towards a plume of signal smoke over a variety of seasons, ground conditions, weather conditions, and environments. Our system was capable of detecting the smoke cloud with both precision and recall rates greater than 0.95 from ranges between 1000m and 1500m. Further, we develop a method to estimate wind orientation and approximate wind strength by assessing the shape of the smoke signal.

The MES ensures the AUV's safety in water and the fault tolerance of its subsystems. The signals produced by the self-test functionality of robot subsystems as well as the parameters measured by sensors are the source information for the MES. Nowadays, MES actions in the AUVs designed by the Institute for Marine Technology Problems (IMTP) are based upon the hypothesis of the isolation of signals. As a result, the robot's reaction to several quasi-simultaneous signals is not always adequate. It is possible to overcome the disadvantages of the existing version of MES with the help of an ontological approach to be used for the implementation of an intelligent MES (IMES). An IMES functions as a tactic-level agent of the information and control system can carry out diagnostic actions (submissions) if necessary. The compiler forms the IMES with the help of a preset knowledge base and description of the robotic configuration with the application of the cloud platform IACPaaS. Knowledge is a semantic network. The architecture of the AUV's IMES consists of three basic blocks: a block for the formation of knowledge on AUV fault diagnostics, a translator that translates knowledge into program code, and the AUV MES itself. Extensive testing of IMES as part of AUV is planned soon.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1537-5; POD:978-1-5090-1527-6","10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7761098","autonomous underwater vehicle;intelligent monitoring and emergency system;knowledge base;mission replanning;ontology of diagnostic situation","Circuit faults;Knowledge based systems;Noise measurement;Robot sensing systems;Vehicles","autonomous underwater vehicles;cloud computing;fault diagnosis;knowledge based systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);sensors;signal processing","AUV IMES function;AUV fault diagnostics;AUV safety;IACPaaS;IMES functions;IMTP;Institute for Marine Technology Problems;MES actions;artificial intelligence techniques;autonomous underwater robotic vehicles;cloud platform;diagnostic actions;fault diagnostics;fault tolerance;intelligent MES;monitoring and emergency systems;ontological approach;quasisimultaneous signals;robot subsystems;robotic configuration;self-test functionality","","1","","","","","19-23 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

As industrial users may be reluctant to share proprietary details of product geometry with outside parties, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach awhere a masked version of the part boundary is uploaded, allowing proprietary aspects of the part geometry to remain confidential. One challenge is the tradeoff between grasp coverage and privacy: balancing the desire for a rich set of alternative grasps based on analysis of graspable surfaces (coverage) against the desire for privacy. We introduce a grasp coverage metric based on dispersion from motion planning, and plot its relationship with privacy (the fraction of the object surface that is masked). We implement the algorithm using Dex-Net 1.0 and present case studies of the privacy-coverage tradeoff on a set of 23 industrial parts. Results suggest that masking the part using the convex hull of the proprietary zone can provide grasp coverage with minor distortion to the object similarity metric used to accelerate grasp planning in Dex-Net 1.0.

HIS requires a more complex high-level design because of its involvement of many different organizations with individual interests and goals. Therefore, an agent-oriented architecture is preferable over other traditional models, such as object-oriented and service-oriented architectures. Through expanding the temporal logic with deontic logic, a novel formal model for agent organization in a multi-agent system is addressed. This new formal description method is more flexible and robust for describing the complex behavior of agent organization, and this, it can be applied to the pervasive HIS and improve its capability for high-level design and description. Recently, remote and pervasive healthcare information systems have become more popular with the development of cloud computing, the internet, and multi-agent systems. HIS is much more complex than many information systems. Therefore, the formal description of a pervasive HIS based on a multi-agent system appears very difficult.

Service requests and responses are forwarded using the store-carry-and-forward principle, and can be cached by intermediate nodes.

We provide a principled framework for the cumulative organization of streaming autobiographical data so that data can be continuously processed and augmented as the processing and reasoning abilities of the agent develop and further interactions with humans take place. As an example, we show how a kinematic structure learning algorithm reasons a-posteriori about the skeleton of a human hand. A partner can be asked to provide feedback about the augmented memories, which can in turn be supplied to the reasoning processes in order to adapt their parameters. We employ active, multimodal remembering, so the robot as well as humans can gain insights of both the original and augmented memories. Our framework is capable of storing discrete and continuous data in real-time. The data can cover multiple modalities and several layers of abstraction (e.g., from raw sound signals over sentences to extracted meanings).

In this paper, a robotic preprocessor is reviewed for the machining robot to convert STL data into cutter location source data called CLS data. The STL originally means Stereolithography which is a file format proposed by 3D Systems and recently is supported by many CAD/CAM softwares. It is also known as Standard Triangulated Language in Japan. The STL is widely spread to rapid prototyping using a 3D printer which is a typical additive manufacturing system. The STL deals with a triangular representation of a 3D surface geometry. Then, triangulated patches generated from smoothed point cloud data (PCD) is described. The process allows to reconstruct 3D digital data of a real object written with STL format from original PCD with noise for reverse engineering. The effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed system are demonstrated through actual machining experiments.","","CD-ROM:978-1-5090-2394-3; Electronic:978-1-5090-2396-7; POD:978-1-5090-2397-4","10.1109/ICMA.2016.7558620","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7558620","","Machining;Robot kinematics;Service robots;Smoothing methods;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays","CAD/CAM;computational geometry;control engineering computing;industrial robots;machining;reverse engineering","3D surface geometry;CAD-CAM software;CLS data;STL data;additive manufacturing system;cutter location source data;foamed polystyrene material;industrial robot;reverse engineering;robotic CAM system;robotic machining;robotic preprocessor;smoothed point cloud data;standard triangulated language;stereolithography;triangulated patches","","","","","","","7-10 Aug. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The need for a mediator is thus evident to coordinate the communication. In this paper, we propose a multi-process mediator framework for Cloud robotics, named CRC2. The proposed framework makes use of the smartphone resources and offers a service-based approach to establish and manage a collaborative communication channel between robot and the Cloud.

Additionally, extra processing time is demanded to estimate the LRF for each local patch. We propose a 3D descriptor which overrides the necessity of a LRF/A reducing dramatically processing time needed. In addition robustness to high levels of noise and non-uniform subsampling is achieved.

If the robot then operates outside a closed environment it is likely to face situations where the tool it knows is not available, but alternative unknown tools are present. We tackle the problem of finding the best substitute tool based solely on 3D vision data. Our approach has simple hand-coded models of known tools in terms of superquadrics and relationships among them. Our system attempts to fit these models to point clouds of unknown tools, producing a numeric value for how good a fit is. This value can be used to rate candidate substitutes. We explicitly control how closely each part of a tool must match our model, under direction from parameters of a target task. We allow bottom-up information from segmentation to dictate the sizes that should be considered for various parts of the tool. These ideas allow for a flexible matching so that tools may be superficially quite different, but similar in the way that matters. We evaluate our system's ratings relative to other approaches and relative to human performance in the same task. This is an approach to knowledge transfer, via a suitable representation and reasoning engine, and we discuss how this could be extended to transfer in planning.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8026-3; POD:978-1-4673-8027-0","10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487400","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7487400","","Computational modeling;Data models;Numerical models;Robots;Shape;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays","computer graphics;manipulators;robot vision","3D vision data;flexible matching;hand-coded models;knowledge transfer;manipulation activities;model-based approach;point clouds;reasoning engine;robot;substitute tools;superquadrics","","","","20","","","16-21 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we define a super ray for points as a representative ray to them with an associated frustum. A super ray is constructed in a way that updating those points has the same set of cells accessed during the map update process. As a result, we can perform the update process with a super ray in a single traversal on the map, resulting in performance improvement without compromising any representation accuracy of the map. For constructing super rays efficiently, we propose mapping lines for handling 2-D and 3-D cases from an observation that edges or grid points branch out the access pattern of updating the map. Our method is general enough to be applied for variety of occupancy map structures based on axis-aligned space subdivisions such as grids and octrees.

We incorporate LIDAR by up-sampling the point cloud to a dense depth map and then extracting three features representing different aspects of the 3D scene. We then use those features as extra image channels. Specifically, we leverage recent work on HHA [9] (horizontal disparity, height above ground, and angle) representations, adapting the code to work on up-sampled LIDAR rather than Microsoft Kinect depth maps. We show, for the first time, that such a representation is applicable to up-sampled LIDAR data, despite its sparsity. Since CNNs learn a deep hierarchy of feature representations, we then explore the question: At what level of representation should we fuse this additional information with the original RGB image channels? We use the KITTI pedestrian detection dataset for our exploration. We first replicate the finding that region-CNNs (R-CNNs) [8] can outperform the original proposal mechanism using only RGB images, but only if fine-tuning is employed. Then, we show that: 1) using HHA features and RGB images performs better than RGB-only, even without any fine-tuning using large RGB web data, 2) fusing RGB and HHA achieves the strongest results if done late, but, under a parameter or computational budget, is best done at the early to middle layers of the hierarchical representation, which tend to represent midlevel features rather than low (e.g. edges) or high (e.g. object class decision) level features, 3) some of the less successful methods have the most parameters, indicating that increased classification accuracy is not simply a function of increased capacity in the neural network.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8026-3; POD:978-1-4673-8027-0","10.1109/ICRA.2016.7487370","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7487370","","Computer architecture;Feature extraction;Laser radar;Neural networks;Proposals;Robot sensing systems;Training","feature extraction;image colour analysis;image fusion;image representation;image sensors;neural nets;object detection;optical radar;pedestrians;traffic engineering computing","3D scene;CNN;HHA features;KITTI pedestrian detection dataset;LIDAR image fusion;Microsoft Kinect depth maps;R-CNN;RGB Web data;RGB image channels;convolutional neural networks;depth map;feature extraction;feature representations;height above ground;horizontal disparity;mid-level feature representation;object class decision;pedestrian detection;region-CNN;up-sampled LIDAR data","","1","","16","","","16-21 May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Our system consists of two components: (1) real-time pose estimation combining RTK-GPS and IMU at 100 Hz and (2) an effective SLAM solution running at 10 Hz using image data from an omnidirectional multi-fisheye-camera system. The SLAM procedure combines spatial resection computed based on the map that is incrementally refined through bundle adjustment and combines the image data with raw GPS observations and IMU data on keyframes. The overall system yields a real-time, georeferenced pose at 100 Hz in GPS-friendly situations. Additionally, we obtain a precise pose and feature map at 10 Hz even in cases where the GPS is not observable or underconstrained. Our system has been implemented and thoroughly tested on a 5 kg copter and yields accurate and reliable pose estimation at high frequencies.

Current work [1] [2] [3] have demonstrated that the depth, height and local surface normal value of a 3D data are useful features for improving Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) based object detection. We thus propose to organise LiDAR point as three different maps: dense depth map, height map and surface normal map. Specifically, given a pair of RGB image and sparse depth map projected from LiDAR point cloud, we propose a parameter self-adaptive method to upgrade sparse depth map to dense depth map, which is then passed to a convex optimisation framework to gain global enhancement. Height map is obtained by reprojecting each pixel in dense depth map into 3D coordinate, which enables us to record its height value, surface normal map is obtained by a trilateral filter constructed from depth map and RGB image. Finally, we validate our framework on both KITTI tracking dataset and Middlebury dataset<sup>1</sup>. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to interpret 3D LiDAR point cloud as various 2D features and hope it will motivate more research on object detection by combing RGB image and 3D LiDAR point cloud.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-9675-2; USB:978-1-4673-9674-5","10.1109/ROBIO.2015.7418964","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7418964","","Bandwidth;Color;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Laser radar;Object detection;Three-dimensional displays","convex programming;image colour analysis;image filtering;neural nets;object detection;optical radar;radar computing;radar imaging","2D depth map;2D perceptual information;3D LiDAR point cloud;DNN based object detection;KITTI tracking dataset;Middlebury dataset;RGB image;convex optimisation framework;deep neural network based object detection;gain global enhancement;height map;parameter self-adaptive method;surface normal map;trilateral filter","","1","","16","","","6-9 Dec. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Complete caging of an object is useful but may not be necessary in cases where forces such as gravity are present. This letter extends caging theory by defining energy-bounded cages with respect to an energy field such as gravity. This letter also introduces energy-bounded-cage-analysis-2-D (EBCA-2-D), a sampling-based algorithm for planar analysis that takes as input an energy function over poses, a polygonal object, and a configuration of rigid fixed polygonal obstacles, e.g., a gripper, and returns a lower bound on the minimum escape energy. In the special case when the object is completely caged, our approach is independent of the energy and can provably verify the cage. EBCA-2-D builds on recent results in collision detection and the computational geometric theory of weighted α-shapes and runs in O(s<sup>2</sup> + sn<sup>2</sup>) time where s is the number of samples, n is the total number of object and obstacle vertices, and typically n <;<; s. We implemented EBCA-2-D and evaluated it with nine parallel-jaw gripper configurations and four nonconvex obstacle configurations across six nonconvex polygonal objects. We found that the lower bounds returned by EBCA-2-D are consistent with intuition, and we verified the algorithm experimentally with Box2-D simulations and RRT* motion planning experiments that were unable to find escape paths with lower energy. EBCA2-D required an average of 3 min per problem on a single-core processor but has potential to be parallelized in a cloud-based implementation.

Such methods are called services on this project, which include 3D point clouds pre-processing algorithms, segmentation of the data, separation and identification of planar zones (ground, roads), and detection of elements of interest (edges, obstacles). Due to the large amount of data to be processed in a short time, these services will use parallel processing elements, using the GPU to perform partial or complete processing of these data. The project aims to provide services for an autonomous car, forcing the services to approach a system for real-time processing, which should complete the whole data processing before the next frame came from the sensors (~10 to 20Hz). The sensor data is structured in the form of a cloud of points, allowing for great parallel processing. However, its major difficulty is the high rate of data received from the sensor (around 700,000 points/sec), and this gives the motivation of this project: to use the full potential of sensor and to efficiently use the parallelism of GPU programming. The GPU services are divided into steps, but always seeking the processing speed given by their intrinsic parallelism: The first step is to organize an environment for parallel processing development in conjunction with the system already being used in our autonomous car, The second step is an intelligent extraction and reorganization of the data provided by the sensor (Velodyne multi-layer laser sensor), The third stage is a pre-segmentation of non-planar data, The fourth stage is performing the segmentation of data received from the previous steps in order to find objects, curbs and ground plane, The fifth stage is to develop a methodology that unite the results of previous steps in order to explore the topology of the environment, i.e. Will aim to structure the results into a topolog- cal form (identifying pathways and links between pathways, such as curves and intersections) to assist other projects that focus on vehicle control and autonomous navigation systems.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7129-2; POD:978-1-4673-7130-8","10.1109/LARS-SBR.2015.50","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7402157","3D point cloud;GPU;parallel processing;sensor data procesing;services","Graphics processing units;Parallel processing;Robot sensing systems;Three-dimensional displays;Vehicles","control engineering computing;graphics processing units;mobile robots;parallel programming;solid modelling","3D point cloud processing;GPU programming;GPU-Services project;Velodyne multilayer laser sensor;data processing;graphics processing unit;intrinsic parallelism;mobile robotics;parallel processing development;robotic systems;three-dimensional sensors data","","","","18","","","29-31 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Traditionally studying underwater deposits of CRC involved physical sampling from Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) or using dredges. Recently, acoustic measurements of crust thickness have been demonstrated that can give a significantly higher spatial resolution for measurement. The probe makes high resolution measurements of sub-surface reflections to calculate the thickness of the deposit. However, CRC coverage is often not continuous and it is difficult to determine from the acoustic signals alone whether an acoustic signal was measured over CRC or not. The authors propose a method to filter these using visual information (3D colour map of the seafloor) from the same region. After locating the acoustic beam on the seafloor, points around the region are selected. A number of analyses are performed on this point cloud to extract parameters that can reliably discriminate between exposed CRC and other types of seafloor. The proposed method was tested on two areas of seafloor - one which is known to contain crust and one which does not contain crust. These two sets of data were then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The trained classifier was then tested with the training sets and a test set containing both crust and non-crust regions to verify if the CRC is being detected reliably. The results were promising; in 85.4% of the cases, the detection was successful. The performance will be verified by using larger sets of data. In our future work, the results can be applied to estimate a volumetric distribution of CRC in the region.","","Electronic:978-0-9339-5743-5","10.23919/OCEANS.2015.7404471","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7404471","","Acoustic measurements;Acoustics;Cameras;Probes;Sea measurements;Shape;Training","geology;geophysical image processing;geophysics computing;image reconstruction;mining;oceanic crust;oceanographic equipment;oceanographic techniques;pattern classification;remotely operated vehicles;seafloor phenomena;support vector machines","3D visual reconstruction;CRC underwater deposit;CRC volumetric distribution;CRC volumetric distribution estimation;ROV;SVM classifier;acoustic beam;acoustic signal measurement;cobalt-rich manganese crust;crust region;crust thickness acoustic measurement;dredges;geology;georegistered acoustic subsurface measurement filtering;higher spatial resolution;manganese crust identification;mining;noncrust region;parameter extraction;physical sampling;remotely operated vehicles;seafloor 3D colour map;seafloor visual information colour map;subsurface reflection high resolution measurement;support vector machine classifier","","","","4","","","19-22 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this way, we avoid the computational overload caused by common dense sequential approaches. The system uses a 3D-2D technique to calculate an initial pose estimate for the intermediate camera frames. A refinement step stated as a Non Linear Least Squares (NLQs) optimisation is performed by minimising the photo-consistency error. The NLQs cost function is defined by aligning a warped image and an image associated to the closest key frame. The minimum solution is calculated using the Levenberg-Marquardt method.

Tracking the patient's performance in the cognitive tests can prove invaluable as the data can be further associated with medical treatment or lifestyle changes and conclusively lead to better understanding of the nature of cognitive decline.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-7545-0; POD:978-1-4673-7546-7","10.1109/EHB.2015.7391355","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7391355","RAPP;cloud computing;cognitive exercise;robotics;social inclusion","Computer architecture;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Robot sensing systems;Senior citizens;Speech","assisted living;cognition;geriatrics;interactive devices;medical disorders;medical robotics;patient treatment","RAPP approach;interactive user friendly;intriguing user friendly;medical treatment;mild cognitive impairment patients;robot-assisted cognitive exercise;senior citizen assistant;socially interactive robots","","2","","11","","","19-21 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Many IoT applications have significant computational requirements, while at the same time they demand very low latencies. The cloud can provide the needed resources on-demand, however often fails to meet these timing requirements. Low response time can only be realized by having computational infrastructure in close vicinity. Therefore we investigate to what extent the cloud can be extended in the direct wireless surroundings of the IoT devices. This environment is highly heterogeneous as it comprises a wide variety of devices, connected using a plethora of technologies (both wired and wireless). A direct implication is that, compared to traditional cloud infrastructure, many of those nodes and links are likely to fail. We propose an application placement that can overcome failure-related challenges. We demonstrate that availability-awareness can increase the number of applications that can be hosted simultaneously by 132%. Furthermore we find that an additional increase of 54% can be realized through redundant provisioning of resources.","","Electronic:978-3-9018-8277-7; POD:978-1-4673-7857-4","10.1109/CNSM.2015.7367359","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7367359","","Bandwidth;Cloud computing;Redundancy;Service-oriented architecture;Substrates;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks","Internet of Things;cloud computing","Internet of Things;IoT;fault-tolerant application placement;heterogeneous cloud environment","","3","","18","","","9-13 Nov. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The algorithm follows the RANSAC framework and is based on finding a pair of congruent triangles in the source and target clouds. With the assumption of planar sensor motion, corresponding vertices of the congruent triangles must have similar elevation values, allowing our algorithm to identify them efficiently. Specifically, given a triangle in the source cloud, our algorithm first finds two vertices of a candidate congruent triangle in the target cloud and then uses the third vertex to verify, minimizing the complexity of the geometric base as well as the expected time of sampling successfully a matching congruent triangle. To improve the performance of our algorithm further, our verification of a hypothetical alignment transformation proceeds first locally by using only the points near the vertices of the congruent triangles before involving the entire cloud. Our experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art registration algorithms in the case of 3-DOF planar sensor motion.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-9994-1; POD:978-1-4799-9995-8; USB:978-1-4799-9993-4","10.1109/IROS.2015.7353632","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7353632","","Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Nearest neighbor searches;Robot sensing systems;Three-dimensional displays","computational geometry;iterative methods;path planning;random processes;robots","3-DOF point cloud registration;RANSAC framework;congruent triangles;planar sensor motion;range sensor;robotics application","","","","18","","","Sept. 28 2015-Oct. 2 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper we consider the presence of sensing systems both on-board each vehicle, and installed on infrastructural elements. While the simultaneous presence of multiple sources of information heavily improves the amount (and quality) of available data, it generates the need for effective data fusion and storage systems. Hence, we introduce a centralized cloud service, that is in charge of receiving and merging data acquired by different sensing systems.

Building a cloud platform especially for the robotics community will benefit not only individual robot developers but also the robotics community since we can share the log corpus collected by it. This is challenging because we need to build a wide variety of functionalities ranging from a stable cloud platform to high-quality multilingual speech recognition and synthesis engines.

An important functionality is to be able to communicate with other devices that we use everyday (say, configuring and controlling the EoT device from a tablet). Apart from low-power hardware components, an efficient protocol is necessary. Text-oriented protocols like HTTP are not appropriate in this context. Instead, the lightweight publish/subscribe MQTT protocol was selected. Still, the typical scenario is that of a device that sends/receives messages, the messages being forwarded by a cloud-based message broker. In this paper we propose a novel approach in which each EoT device acts as an MQTT broker instead of the typical cloud-based architecture.

A subsequent step then estimates the Euclidean transformation between the point clouds using either a point-to-point or point-to-plane error metric, with a novel method based on a normal covariance test for automatically selecting between them. Together, Lucas-Kanade data association with covariance testing enables robust camera tracking through areas of low geometric features, without sacrificing accuracy in environments in which the existing ICP technique succeeds.

Many types of infrastructure are primarily comprised of arbitrarily-shaped thin structures (e.g., Truss bridges, steel frame buildings under construction, and transmission towers), which existing automatic modeling methods are incapable of handling. To address this issue, this paper presents an approach to automatically recognize and model beams, planes, and joints from a 3D point cloud containing a complex network of thin structures, and to recover their topology. In our approach, each beam is evolved from a seed by matching and aligning the cross section images. This growing algorithm can model beams with arbitrary cross sections. By performing the algorithm on a point connectivity graph, we distinguish beams from joints and improve the algorithm's robustness to closely spaced objects. In parallel, planes and joints are also extracted and modeled. The connectivity graph of these primitives allows for a compact, object-level understanding of the entire structure. We demonstrate the capability and robustness of our approach on both synthetic and real datasets.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-8332-5; POD:978-1-4673-8333-2","10.1109/3DV.2015.12","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7335467","3D shape retrieval and recognition;Reverse engineering;Robotics;Scene analysis","Complex networks;Joints;Laser beams;Shape;Solid modeling;Structural beams;Three-dimensional displays","civil engineering computing;image processing","3D point cloud;arbitrary cross sections;automatic modeling methods;automatic recovery;cross section images;growing algorithm;object-level understanding;point connectivity graph","","2","","19","","","19-22 Oct. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The main objective is to create a flexible platform designed to facilitate the design of embedded systems for ubiquitous applications. This platform is suitable for users with low programming skills. As a proof of concept, the authors choose as ubiquitous system a mobile robot that its functionality can be modified easily by the proposed platform. The compilation of the code corresponding to the new robot functionality is obtained using a distant CLOUD server, the program is compiled there, then loaded to the robot using a wireless programmer.

The SURF algorithm is implemented over an image whose pixel coordinates have a direct corresponding 3D point, thus allowing the fusion of both approaches. By combining both methodologies, it is intent to define a set of interest points whose descriptors are able to maintain the intrinsic characteristics of its constituent parts such as repeatability, distinctiveness and robustness while remaining compact and fast to compute.

The user's head posture is tracked, to accordingly project a colored spot on the ground ahead, with a pan-tilt mounted laser. The laser dot on the ground represents a potential close range destination the operator wants to reach autonomously. The wheelchair is equipped with a low cost depth-camera (Kinect sensor) that models a traversability map in order to define if the designated destination is reachable or not by the chair. If reachable, the red laser dot turns green, and the operator can validate the wheelchair destination via an Electromyogram (EMG) device, detecting a specific group of muscle's contraction. This validating action triggers the calculation of a path toward the laser pointed target, based on the traversability map. The wheelchair is then controlled to follow this path autonomously. In the future, the stream of 3D point cloud acquired during the process will be used to map and self localize the wheelchair in the environment, to be able to correct the estimate of the pose derived from the wheel's encoders.","1946-0740;19460740","Electronic:978-1-4673-7929-8; POD:978-1-4673-7930-4; USB:978-1-4673-7928-1","10.1109/ETFA.2015.7301605","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7301605","","Magnetic heads;Mobile robots;Navigation;Robot sensing systems;Three-dimensional displays;Wheelchairs","control engineering computing;electromyography;handicapped aids;medical robotics;wheelchairs","3D point cloud;EMG device;Kinect sensor;depth-camera;electromyogram;head posture;laser based driving assistance;paralyzed people;smart robotic wheelchairs","","","","14","","","8-11 Sept. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The 3D map of the terrain, computed at the camera frame rate is suitable for vision based planned locomotion. The inertial measurements are used before and after the ICP registration, to provide a good initial guess, to correct the output and to detect registration failures which can potentially corrupt the map. The performance in terms of time and accuracy are also doubled by preprocessing the point clouds with a background subtraction prior to performing the ICP alignment. Our local mapping approach, in spite of having a global frame of reference fixed onto the ground, aligns the current map to the body frame, and allows us to push the drift away from the most recent camera scan.

Unlike existing state of the art methods, which produce only point-based 3D models on the phone, or require cloud-based processing, our hybrid GPU/CPU pipeline is unique in that it creates a connected 3D surface model directly on the device at 25Hz. In each frame, we perform dense 6DoF tracking, which continuously registers the RGB input to the incrementally built 3D model, minimizing a noise aware photoconsistency error metric. This is followed by efficient key-frame selection, and dense per-frame stereo matching. These depth maps are fused volumetrically using a method akin to KinectFusion, producing compelling surface models. For each frame, the implicit surface is extracted for live user feedback and pose estimation. We demonstrate scans of a variety of objects, and compare to a Kinect-based baseline, showing on average ~ 1.5cm error.

However, the real-time representation of this data in the form of tangible haptic experience has not been challenged enough, especially in the case of telepresence for individuals with visual impairments. Thus, the proposed system addresses the real-time haptic exploration of remote 3D information through video encoding and real-time 3D haptic rendering of the remote real-world environment. This paper investigates two scenarios in haptic telepresence, i.e., mobile navigation and object exploration in a remote environment. Participants with and without visual impairments participated in our experiments based on the two scenarios, and the system performance was validated.

When using commercial RGB-Depth (RGB-D) cameras, material properties can significantly affect depth measurements. In particular, transparent objects are difficult to perceive with RGB images and commercially available depth sensors. Geometric information of such objects needs to be gathered with additional sensors, and in many scenarios, it is of interest to gather this information without physical contact. In this work, a non-contact pretouch sensor fixed to the robot end effector is used to sense and explore physical geometries previously unobserved. Thus, the point cloud representation of an unknown, transparent grasp target, can be enhanced through telerobotic exploration in real-time. Furthermore, real-time haptic rendering algorithms and haptic virtual fixtures used in combination with the augmented streaming point clouds assist the teleoperator in collision avoidance during exploration. Theoretical analyses are performed to design virtual fixtures suitable for pretouch sensing, and experiments show the effectiveness of this method to gather geometry data without collision and eventually to successfully grasp a transparent object.","1050-4729;10504729","Electronic:978-1-4799-6923-4; POD:978-1-4799-6924-1; USB:978-1-4799-6922-7","10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139887","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7139887","","Cameras;End effectors;Haptic interfaces;Robot sensing systems;Three-dimensional displays","collision avoidance;control engineering computing;haptic interfaces;image colour analysis;image representation;rendering (computer graphics);sensors;telerobotics","RGB images;RGB-D camera;augmented streaming point cloud;collision avoidance;commercial RGB-Depth camera;depth measurement;depth sensor;geometric information;haptic virtual fixture;material property;oncontact pretouch sensor;point cloud representation;pretouch proximity sensor information;pretouch sensing;real-time haptic rendering algorithm;robot end effector;sensor-aided teleoperated grasping;streaming point cloud data;teleoperator;telerobotic exploration;theoretical analysis;transparent grasp target;transparent objects;transparent target","","0","","19","","","26-30 May 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

We present a large, gender-balanced, annotated, multi-perspective RGB-D dataset with full-body views of over a hundred different persons captured with both the Kinect v1 and Kinect v2 sensor. We then learn and compare several classifiers on the Kinect v2 data using a HOG baseline, two state-of-the-art deep-learning methods, and a recent tessellation-based learning approach. Originally developed for person detection in 3D data, the latter is able to learn the best selection, location and scale of a set of simple point cloud features.

In this paper, we explore the use of Gaussian process implicit surfaces (GPISs) to represent shape uncertainty from RGBD point cloud observations of objects. We study the use of GPIS representations to select grasps on previously unknown objects, measuring grasp quality by the probability of force closure. Our main contribution is GP-GPIS-OPT, an algorithm for computing grasps for parallel-jaw grippers on 2D GPIS object representations. Specifically, our method optimizes an approximation to the probability of force closure subject to antipodal constraints on the parallel jaws using Sequential Convex Programming (SCP). We also introduce GPIS-Blur, a method for visualizing 2D GPIS models based on blending shape samples from a GPIS. We test the algorithm on a set of 8 planar objects with transparency, translucency, and specularity. Our experiments suggest that GP-GPIS-OPT computes grasps with higher probability of force closure than a planner that does not consider shape uncertainty on our test objects and may converge to a grasp plan up to 5.7×faster than using Monte-Carlo integration, a common method for grasp planning under shape uncertainty. Furthermore, initial experiments on the Willow Garage PR2 robot suggest that grasps selected with GP-GPIS-OPT are up to 90% more successful than those planned assuming a deterministic shape.

We apply this method to the problem of detecting safe landing zones for autonomous helicopters from LiDAR point clouds. Current methods for this problem rely on heuristic rules and use simple geometric features. These heuristics break down in the presence of low vegetation, as they do not distinguish between vegetation that may be landed on and solid objects that should be avoided.

Such places, in fact, very often are not equipped to provide access for mobility impaired people, in particular because these aids require dedicated infrastructures that may not fit within the environment and large investments. For this reason, people affected by mobility impairments are often unable to enjoy a part or even the entire museum experience. Solutions allowing mobility impaired people to enjoy museum experience are often based on recorded tours, thus they do not allow active participation of the user. On the contrary, the presented platform is intended to allow users to enjoy completely the museum round. A robot equipped with a camera is placed within the museum and users can control it in order to follow predefined tours or freely explore the museum. Our solution ensures that users see exactly what the robot is seing in real-time. The cloud robotics platform controls both navigation capabilities and teleoperation. Navigation tasks are intended to let the robot reliably follow pre-defined tours, while main concern of teleoperation tasks is to ensure robot safety (e.g., by means of dynamic obstacle detection and avoidance software).

The purpose of our work was to develop an accessible system and implement to root for other field's researchers.

The middle sections of the article introduce and describe specific information about these objectives. We also explain the results of its experimental implementations to an autonomous environmental monitoring robot named Waseda Animal Monitoring robot (WAMOT).

To improve the situation, a knowledge-based approach exploiting distributed declarative information and cloud computing offers many possibilities for knowledge exchange and reuse, and it has the potential to facilitate new business models for industrial solutions. However, there are many unresolved questions yet, e.g., those related to reliability, consistency, or legal responsibility. To investigate some of these issues, different knowledge-based architectures have been prototyped and evaluated by confronting the solution candidates with key application demands. The conclusion is that distributed cloud-based approaches offer many possibilities, but there is still a need for further research and better infrastructure before this approach can become industrially attractive.","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2015.2408264","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7058453","Cognitive robotics;online knowledge bases;reuse of knowledge;robot programming;web services for robots","Computer architecture;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Software","batch processing (industrial);cloud computing;knowledge based systems;production control;production engineering computing;robotic assembly","cloud computing;distributed declarative information;distributed knowledge bases;industrial robot;knowledge-based architectures;robotized small-batch assembly","","3","","28","","20150311","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

In this work, we describe the RoboEarth semantic mapping system. The semantic map is composed of: 1) an ontology to code the concepts and relations in maps and objects and 2) a SLAM map providing the scene geometry and the object locations with respect to the robot. We propose to ground the terminological knowledge in the robot perceptions by means of the SLAM map of objects. RoboEarth boosts mapping by providing: 1) a subdatabase of object models relevant for the task at hand, obtained by semantic reasoning, which improves recognition by reducing computation and the false positive rate; 2) the sharing of semantic maps between robots; and 3) software as a service to externalize in the cloud the more intensive mapping computations, while meeting the mandatory hard real time constraints of the robot. To demonstrate the RoboEarth cloud mapping system, we investigate two action recipes that embody semantic map building in a simple mobile robot. The first recipe enables semantic map building for a novel environment while exploiting available prior information about the environment. The second recipe searches for a novel object, with the efficiency boosted thanks to the reasoning on a semantically annotated map. Our experimental results demonstrate that, by using RoboEarth cloud services, a simple robot can reliably and efficiently build the semantic maps needed to perform its quotidian tasks. In addition, we show the synergetic relation of the SLAM map of objects that grounds the terminological knowledge coded in the ontology.","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2014.2377791","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7015601","Cloud mapping;knowledge representation;object recognition;semantic mapping;visual SLAM","Knowledge based systems;Navigation;Search problems;Semantics;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Visualization","SLAM (robots);Web services;cloud computing;control engineering computing;intelligent robots;mobile robots;object recognition;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","RoboEarth semantic mapping system;SLAM map;Web services;cloud enabled knowledge-based approach;cloud services;intelligent robot;mobile robot;object locations;object model subdatabase;ontology;scene geometry;semantic reasoning;software as a service","","11","","52","","20150120","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

To execute these task-parallel algorithms in resource- and time-constrained environments, dynamic and reliable collaboration between local networked robots (e.g., AUVs) and remote public Clouds is needed. To this end, the heterogeneous sensing, computing, communication, and storage capabilities of local and remote resources are exploited to form a “loosely coupled” mobile Cloud, and a novel resource provisioning engine that dynamically takes decisions on “what” and “where” the tasks should be executed in the mobile Cloud is introduced.

With multiple robots, a cloud robotic system enables intensive and complicated tasks to be carried out in an optimal and cooperative manner. Multisensor data retrieval (MSDR) is one of the key fundamental tasks to share the resources. Having attracted wide attention, MSDR is facing severe technical challenges. For example, MSDR is particularly difficult when cloud cluster hosts accommodate unpredictable data requests triggered by multiple robots operating in parallel. In these cases, near real-time responses are essential while addressing the problem of the synchronization of multisensor data simultaneously. In this paper, we present a framework targeting near real-time MSDR, which grants asynchronous access to the cloud from the robots. We propose a market-based management strategy for efficient data retrieval. It is validated by assessing several quality-of-service (QoS) criteria, with emphasis on facilitating data retrieval in near real-time. Experimental results indicate that the MSDR framework is able to achieve excellent performance under the proposed management strategy in typical cloud robotic scenarios.","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2015.2408634","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7060735","Cloud robotic system;multisensor fusion;real-time data retrieval","Optimization;Quality of service;Real-time systems;Resource management;Robot sensing systems","cloud computing;quality of service;sensor fusion;sensors;service robots;synchronisation","QoS criteria;asynchronous access;cloud cluster hosts;cloud robotic scenarios;cloud robotic systems;cloud technology;market-based management strategy;multiple robots;quality of service criteria;real-time MSDR framework;real-time multisensor data retrieval;real-time responses;synchronization;unpredictable data requests","","10","","54","","20150313","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The framework addresses the challenges associated with conducting a task-oriented and real-time robot competition, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Virtual Robotics Challenge (VRC), designed to mimic reality. The core of the framework is the Gazebo simulator, a platform to simulate robots, objects, and environments, as well as the enhancements made for the VRC to maintain a high fidelity simulation using a high degree of freedom and multisensor robot. The other major component used is the CloudSim tool, designed to enhance the automation of robotics simulation using existing cloud technologies. The results from the VRC and a discussion are also detailed in this work. Note to Practitioners - Advances in robot simulation, cloud hosted infrastructure, and web technology have made it possible to accurately and efficiently simulate complex robots and environments on remote servers while providing realistic data streams for human-in-the-loop robot control. This paper presents the software and hardware frameworks established to facilitate cloud-hosted robot simulation, and addresses the challenges associated with conducting a task-oriented robot competition designed to mimic reality. The competition that spurred this innovation was the VRC, a precursor to the DARPA Robotics Challenge, in which teams from around the world utilized custom human-robot interfaces and control code to solve disaster response-related tasks in simulation. Winners of the VRC received both funding and access to Atlas, a humanoid robot developed by Boston Dynamics. The Gazebo simulator, an open source and high fidelity robot simulator, was improved upon to met the needs of the VRC competition. Additionally, CloudSim was created to act as an interface between users and the cloud-hosted simulations. As a result of this work, we have achieved automated deployment of cloud resources f- r robotic simulations, near real-time simulation performance, and simulation accuracy that closely mimics real hardware. These tools have been released under open source licenses and are freely available, and can be used to help reduce robot and algorithm design and development time, and increase robot software robustness.","1545-5955;15455955","","10.1109/TASE.2014.2368997","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7014315","Cloud robotics;real-time robot simulation;robotic disaster response","Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Computers;Real-time systems;Robot sensing systems;Servers","cloud computing;control engineering computing;digital simulation;human-robot interaction;humanoid robots;public domain software;rescue robots","Atlas humanoid robot;CloudSim tool;DARPA;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency;Gazebo simulator;VRC;Web technology;cloud-hosted robot simulation;human-in-the-loop robot control;human-robot interfaces;multisensor robot;open source robot simulator;real-time robot competition;real-time robotic disaster response;software framework;task-oriented robot competition;virtual robotics challenge","","12","","32","","20150119","April 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

The objective is to perform indoor localization efficiently and keeping the cost as low as possible so as to make it commercializable. Here, we introduce an approach based on recognizing a pattern generated by laser pointers on the wall, which is captured by an infrared camera. The image of this pattern is used to locate the position of a robot in the room. The problem of working under black ceiling has been overcomed because the projection is on the wall and is moving which also increases the range of operation.

First, ground extraction is performed using random sample consensus for model parameter estimation. Afterwards, to downsample the point cloud, a voxel grid filtering is executed and octree data structure is used. This data structure enables an efficient detection of differences between two consecutive point clouds, based on which clustering of dynamic parts of the cloud is performed. The obtained clusters are then expanded over the set of static voxels in order to cover entire objects. In order to account for ego-motion an iterative closest point registration technique with an initial transformation guess obtained by odometry of the platform is used. As the final step, we present a tracking algorithm based on joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) filter with variable process and measurement noise taking into account velocity and position of the tracked objects. However, JPDA filter assumes a constant and known number of objects in the scene, and therefore we use track management based on entropy. Experiments are performed using a setup consisting of a Velodyne HDL-32E mounted on top of a mobile platform in order to verify the developed algorithms.","","Electronic:978-9-8975-8062-8; POD:978-1-4799-7920-2","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7049590","Detection of Moving Objects;JPDA Filter;Laser Range Sensor;Tracking","Data structures;Heuristic algorithms;Noise measurement;Object detection;Pipelines;Robot sensing systems;Three-dimensional displays","","","","0","","31","","","1-3 Sept. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

A spiking neural network (SNN) is used to model the neuromodulatory function for generating context based behavioral responses of the robots to sensory input signals. The neural network incorporates three types of neurons- cholinergic and noradrenergic (ACh/NE) neurons for attention focusing and action selection, dopaminergic (DA) neurons for rewards- and curiosity-seeking, and serotonergic (5-HT) neurons for risk aversion behaviors. The model depicts description of neuron activity that is biologically realistic but computationally efficient to allow for large-scale simulation of thousands of neurons. The model is implemented using graphics processing units (GPUs) for parallel computing in real-time using the ROS environment. The model is implemented to study the risk-taking, risk-aversive, and distracted behaviors of the neuromodulated robots in single- and multi-robot configurations. The entire process is implemented in a distributed computing framework using ROS where the robots communicate wirelessly with the computing nodes through the on-board laptops.

The size of point-cloud data is a limitation when transmitting in poor and unstable network environments in real-time. Therefore, to perform robust teleoperation, it is necessary to compress point-cloud data at the remote location and transmit it in real-time. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is verified by applying it in indoor and outdoor mapping with a 3G network system.

RGB-D cameras, such as the Microsoft Kinect, allow us to capture 3D depth data in addition to RGB images, providing a significantly richer user experience than flat video, which may provide improved situational awareness for first responders. However, the richer data comes at a higher cost in terms of data throughput and computing power requirements. In this paper we consider the problem of live streaming RGB-D data over wired and wireless communication channels, using low-power, embedded computing equipment. When assessing a disaster environment, a range camera is typically mounted on a ground or aerial robot along with the onboard computer system. Ground robots can use both wireless radio and tethers for communications, whereas aerial robots can only use wireless communication. We propose a hybrid lossless and lossy streaming compression format designed specifically for RGB-D data and investigate the feasibility and usefulness of live-streaming this data in disaster situations.","2374-3247;23743247","Electronic:978-1-4799-4199-5; POD:978-1-4799-4198-8","10.1109/SSRR.2014.7017650","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7017650","3D;USAR;compression;point cloud;response robot;streaming;video","Computers;Hardware;Image coding;Robots;Servers;Three-dimensional displays;Wireless communication","aerospace robotics;cameras;data compression;image colour analysis;rescue robots;robot vision;video streaming","3D depth data capture;Microsoft Kinect;RGB images;RGB-D cameras;RGB-D data streaming;USAR operations;aerial robots;computing power requirements;data throughput;disaster environment;live streaming;lossless compression scheme;lossy compression scheme;low-power embedded computing equipment;mobile robots;red-green-blue-depth data;tethers;urban search and rescue;wireless radio","","0","","10","","","27-30 Oct. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In the learning process of each method, we employed three learning tasks to optimize the walking gait, which are aiming at generating a gait with higher speed, stability and flexibility respectively. We analyzed the gaits optimized by each four methods separately. According to the comparison of these results, it indicates that DE performs better than the other three algorithms.

Our first contribution over prior work in superpixel labeling using optical flow templates is large improvements in accuracy and efficiency by inference directly from spatiotemporal gradients instead of from independently-computed optical flow, and from improved optical flow modeling for obstacles.

Our challenge here is how to make the natural calling gesture recognition work in a cluttered and randomly moving objects. In this approach, there are two modes of our calling gesture recognition: Skeleton based gesture recognition and Octree based gesture recognition. Individual people is segmented out from 3D point cloud acquired by Microsoft Kinect, skeleton is generated for each segment, face detection is applied to identify whether the segment is human or not, specific natural calling gestures are designed based on skeleton joints. For the case that user is sitting on a chair or sofa, correct skeleton cannot be generated, Octree based gesture recognition procedure is used to recognize the gesture, in which human segments with head and hand are identified by face detection as well as specific geometrical constrains and skin color evidence.

Previously it was assumed that delays in network communication would inhibit control systems from leveraging networked resources such as remote compute power. Now, industrial and residential applications of the Internet of Things force us to revisit principled deployment and support of distributed sensing and actuation. Web standards provide key resources in the development and support of flexible distributed systems, however the conventional wisdom is that their use adds to the network delay and uncertainty, and makes a difficult control problem intractable. We quantify the effect of an important set of web standards (both formal and informal) in the control of physical systems.

Multi-sensor data fusion allows for more complete and accurate representations. Furthermore, using distinct sensing modalities (i.e. sensors using a different physical process and/or operating at different electromagnetic frequencies) usually leads to more reliable perception, especially in challenging environments, as modalities may complement each other. However, they may react differently to certain materials or environmental conditions, leading to catastrophic fusion. In this paper, we propose a new method to reliably fuse data from multiple sensing modalities, including in situations where they detect different targets. We first compute distinct continuous surface representations for each sensing modality, with uncertainty, using Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces (GPIS). Second, we perform a local consistency test between these representations, to separate consistent data (i.e. data corresponding to the detection of the same target by the sensors) from inconsistent data. The consistent data can then be fused together, using another GPIS process, and the rest of the data can be combined as appropriate. The approach is first validated using synthetic data. We then demonstrate its benefit using a mobile robot, equipped with a laser scanner and a radar, which operates in an outdoor environment in the presence of large clouds of airborne dust and smoke.","","Electronic:978-8-4901-2355-3; POD:978-1-4799-1634-4","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6916262","","Data integration;Laser radar;Robot sensing systems;Robustness;Surface treatment;Uncertainty","Gaussian processes;sensor fusion","GPIS process;Gaussian process implicit surfaces;airborne dust;consistent data;distinct continuous surface representations;inconsistent data;laser scanner;local consistency test;mobile robot;multiple-sensing-modality data fusion;radar;smoke","","0","","25","","","7-10 July 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In addition to analyzing kinematic parameters (joint positions/velocities, etc.), CGDA focuses on changes produced on the object due to an action (spatial, color, shape, etc.). By tracking object features during action execution, we create a trajectory in an n-dimensional feature space that represents object temporal states. Discretized action repetitions provide us with a cloud of points. Action generalization is accomplished by extracting the average point of each sequential temporal interval of the point cloud. These points are interpolated using Radial Basis Functions, obtaining a generalized multidimensional object feature trajectory. Action recognition is performed by comparing the trajectory of a query sample with the generalizations. The trajectories discrepancy score is obtained by using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).

A Markov random field is employed to model the joint probability of point labels, which can take on a number of user-defined surface classes. The probability of a point depends on both local spatial features of the point cloud around the point as well as the classifications of points in its neighborhood.

The method is applied to stair and ladder detection from noisy and partial scans using three types of sensors: a sweeping laser sensor, time-offlight depth camera, and a Kinect depth camera.

Beyond the conventional map which represents the existence of wall and objects, Human Motion Map represents not only the existence of humans in a particular location but also motion distributions. With recent improvements of the cloud computing technology, Human Motion Map can be accumulated as a kind of big data while measurements of robots are performed continuingly while it is moving around.

The hand pose and posture are estimated by fitting a virtual hand model to the 3D point cloud obtained from a Kinect camera using an inverse kinematics approach. We use real human hand movements captured with a Vicon motion tracking system as the ground truth for deriving natural hand synergies based on principal component analysis. These synergies are integrated in the tracking scheme by optimizing the posture in a reduced parameter space. Tracking in this reduced space combined with joint limit avoidance constrains the posture estimation to natural hand articulations.

Adding to them the voracious needs for data of the traditional broadband users, residential or business, together with the back/front hauling requirements of mobile operators, one is expecting a significant strain in the access. A multitude of heterogeneous access networks are emerging and the integration of them in a single platform ensuring seamless data-exchange with Data-Centres is of major importance. In this paper we describe HYDRA (HYbriD long-Reach fiber Access network), a novel network architecture that overcomes the limitations of both long-reach PONs as well as mobile backhauling schemes, leading to significantly improved cost and power consumption figures. The key concept is the introduction of an Active Remote Node (ARN) that interfaces to end-users by means of the lowest cost/power consumption technology (short-range xPON, wireless, etc.) whilst on the core network side it employs adaptive ultra-long reach links to bypass the Metropolitan Area Network. The scheme leads to a higher degree of node consolidation, network convergence and Access-Core integration. The proposed architecture can enhance performance while supporting network virtualization and efficient resource orchestration based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles and open access networking models.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5280-9; POD:978-1-4799-5281-6","10.1109/EuCNC.2014.6882669","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6882669","Ubiquitous network infrastructure;network convergence;optical networks;software defined networking","Computer architecture;Mobile communication;Optical fibers;Passive optical networks;Wavelength division multiplexing","Internet of Things;computer centres;computer network performance evaluation;electronic data interchange;mobile computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);passive optical networks;telecommunication network routing;virtualisation","HYDRA;Internet-of-things;IoT;M2M interactions;PON;SDN principles;access-core integration;active remote node;back hauling requirement;cloud robotics;communication ontology;cost consumption technology;data centres;data exchange;distributed aggregation;distributed manufacturing;economy revitalization;front hauling requirement;grid-based energy systems;heterogeneous access networks;hybrid long-reach fiber access network;information routing;machine-to-machine interactions;mobile backhauling scheme;mobile operators;network convergence;network processing;network virtualization;next generation optical network architecture;node consolidation;open access networking models;passive optical network;power consumption technology;production forms;resource orchestration;short-range xPON;social life sustainability;software defined networking principles","","4","","14","","","23-26 June 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Additionally, they do not prevent data loss between robots if a failure occurs in the communication link. During a distributed mapping task, loss of data is critical because it will corrupt the global map.

SOAR features real-time debris detection and coverage-based rotation scheduling algorithms. The image processing algorithms for debris detection are specifically designed to address the unique challenges in aquatic environments. The rotation scheduling algorithm provides effective coverage of sporadic debris arrivals despite camera's limited angular view. Moreover, SOAR is able to dynamically offload computation-intensive processing tasks to the cloud for battery power conservation. We have implemented a SOAR prototype and conducted extensive experimental evaluation. The results show that SOAR can accurately detect debris in the presence of various environment and system dynamics, and the rotation scheduling algorithm enables SOAR to capture debris arrivals with reduced energy consumption.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-3147-7; POD:978-1-4799-3148-4","10.1109/IPSN.2014.6846737","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6846737","Robotic sensor;aquatic debris;computer vision;object detection;smartphone","Cameras;Energy consumption;Monitoring;Robot vision systems","Android (operating system);cameras;computerised monitoring;control engineering computing;geophysical image processing;image sensors;mobile computing;mobile robots;oceanographic techniques;scheduling;smart phones;video surveillance","SOAR;aquatic debris monitoring;battery power conservation;camera;coverage-based rotation scheduling algorithm;dynamically offload computation-intensive processing;ecosystem;energy consumption;gliding robotic fish;human health;image processing algorithm;marine life;off-the-shelf Android smart phone;real-time debris detection;rotation scheduling algorithm;smartphone-based robotic sensor;vision-based surveillance robot system;water transport","","2","","33","","","15-17 April 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Here the global feature we used is Clustered Viewpoint Feature Histogram (CVFH) feature from Point Cloud Library (PCL). For real-time gor we must preprocess all the point cloud images streamed from the Kinect into clusters based on a clustering threshold and the min-max cluster sizes related to the size of the model, for reducing the amount of the clusters and improving the processing speed, and also compute the CVFH features of the clusters. For every cluster of a frame image, we search the several nearer features from the model database with the KNN method in the feature space, and we just consider the nearest model. If the strings of the model name contain the strings of the object to be recognized, it can be considered that we have recognized the general object; otherwise, we compute another cluster again and perform the above steps.

This often requires design and use of special purpose fixtures and programming between manufacturing operations. Our goal is to remove these requirements and automate the discovery of position (localization) of the workpiece. For quick setup and localization we have augmented the end-effector of the robot with a laser projector and a laser displacement sensor. The laser projector guides the worker in initial fixture and workpiece placement and the laser displacement sensor acquires a 3D point cloud of the workspace. The point cloud collected after scanning the workspace is processed to provide a sparse outline of the workpiece. This outline is then compared to the computer aided design (CAD) data of the workpiece to estimate a transformation between the actual and planned position. This estimation is made by using an iterative closest point algorithm. Multiple searches are run using different seed points to improve the chance of finding the best fit while maintaining low run times. In this paper, we have used flat weldments as test cases. In our experiments we were able to localize and weld workpieces with significant time savings against current practices in manual welding.","2161-8070;21618070","Electronic:978-1-4799-1515-6; POD:978-1-4799-1513-2; USB:978-1-4799-1514-9","10.1109/CoASE.2013.6654062","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6654062","","Design automation;Fixtures;Inspection;Lasers;Robot sensing systems;Welding","CAD;control engineering computing;end effectors;industrial manipulators;iterative methods;position control;production engineering computing;robotic welding;sensors;solid modelling","3D point cloud;CAD data;automated workpiece localization;computer aided design;end effector;flat weldments;iterative closest point algorithm;laser displacement sensor;laser projector;manufacturing operations;robotic manufacturing;robotic welding;seed points;special purpose fixtures;time savings;workpiece position;workpiece position discovery","","3","","10","","","17-20 Aug. 2013","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In this paper, we present new collision- and distance-query algorithms, which can efficiently handle large amounts of point cloud sensor data received at real-time rates. We present two novel techniques to accelerate the computation of broad-phase data structures: 1) we present a progressive technique that incrementally computes a high-quality dynamic AABB tree for fast culling, and 2) we directly use an octree representation of the point cloud data as a proximity data structure. We assign a probability value to each leaf node of the tree, and the algorithm computes the nodes corresponding to high collision probability.

Such sensors may fail to detect a subset of the visible targets or return false positive detections. These measurement sets are used to localize the targets using the Probability Hypothesis Density, or PHD, filter. Robots communicate with each other on a local peer-to-peer basis and with a server or the cloud via access points, exchanging measurements and poses to update their belief about the targets and plan future actions. The server provides a mechanism to collect and synthesize information from all robots and to share the global, albeit time-delayed, belief state to robots near access points. We design a decentralized control scheme that exploits this communication architecture and the PHD representation of the belief state. Specifically, robots move to maximize mutual information between the target set and measurements, both self-collected and those available by accessing the server, balancing local exploration with sharing knowledge across the team.

We present a novel method to combine laser and camera data to achieve accurate velocity estimates of moving vehicles. We combine sparse laser points with a high-resolution camera image to obtain a dense colored point cloud. We use a color-augmented search algorithm to align the dense color point clouds from successive time frames for a moving vehicle, thereby obtaining a precise estimate of the tracked vehicle's velocity. Using this alignment method, we obtain velocity estimates at a much higher accuracy than previous methods. Through pre-filtering, we are able to achieve near real time results. We also present an online method for real-time use with accuracies close to that of the full method. We present a novel approach to quantitatively evaluate our velocity estimates by tracking a parked car in a local reference frame in which it appears to be moving relative to the ego vehicle. We use this evaluation method to automatically quantitatively evaluate our tracking performance on 466 separate tracked vehicles. Our method obtains a mean absolute velocity error of 0.27 m/s and an RMS error of 0.47 m/s on this test set.

The images were obtained by a downward looking camera on an autonomous helicopter along the San Andreas fault [9]. A 3D point cloud is built by fusing GPS information with the aerial images. Our approach to detect changes is to compare the LiDAR data with 3D point cloud derived from aerial images. This comparison necessitates the two point clouds to be in the same co-ordinate frame. We adopt a registration approach to bring the point clouds to the same co-ordinate frame. We highlight the challenges involved in registering aerial point clouds and propose a semi automated way for registration. We also present a simulation of a change detection scenario by introducing displacement fields in the source point cloud and obtaining a target point cloud by additionally simulating the GPS offsets.

In this paper, we propose a method for calibrating a dual laser triangulation system - consisting of a camera, two line lasers, and a linear motion platform designed to perform completeness inspection tasks on an assembly line. Calibration of such a system involves the recovery of two sets of parameters - the plane parameters of the two line lasers, and the translational direction of the linear motion platform. First, we address these two calibration problems separately. While many solutions have been given for the former problem, the latter problem has been largely ignored. Next, we highlight an issue specific to the use of multiple lasers - that small errors in the calibration parameters can lead to misalignment between the reconstructed point clouds of the different lasers. We present two different procedures that can eliminate such misalignments by imposing constraints between the two sets of calibration parameters. Our calibration method requires only the use of planar checkerboard patterns, which can be produced easily and inexpensively.","","Electronic:978-1-4673-2706-0; POD:978-1-4673-2705-3","10.1109/ROSE.2012.6402621","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6402621","conveyor calibration;dual lasers;laser calibration;laser triangulation;misalignment","Belts;Calibration;Cameras;Estimation;Image reconstruction;Laser noise;Lasers","assembling;automatic optical inspection;calibration;image motion analysis;image reconstruction;measurement by laser beam;production engineering computing;quality control","3D measurement technology;assembly line completeness inspection;calibration;controlled industrial environment;laser triangulation system;line laser;linear motion platform;metrology;planar checkerboard pattern;plane parameter;point cloud reconstruction;quality inspection;translational motion direction","","2","","16","","","16-18 Nov. 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The inability to constantly distinguish tracked points limits interaction naturalness and design possibilities. In this paper we present a real time algorithm capable of dealing with points indexing matter. Compared to other solutions, the presented research adds a computed indexing correction to keep coherent indexing throughout the tracking session. The correction is applied automatically by the system, whenever a specific configuration is detected. Our solution works with an arbitrary number of points and it was primarily designed for fingertips tracking.

However, many technical challenges persist, for example Multi-Sensor Data Retrieval (MSDR) is particularly difficult when Cloud Cluster Hosts accommodate unpredictable data requested by multi robots in parallel. Moreover, the synchronization of multi-sensor data mostly requires near real-time response of different message types.

In contrast to traditional approaches, our technique is not based on image features and does not require correspondences to be generated between frames of data. Instead, consecutive functions are correlated using spherical harmonic analysis. An Extended Gaussian Image (EGI), created from the local normal estimates of a point cloud, defines each function. Correlations are efficiently computed using Fourier transformations, resulting in a 3 Degree of Freedom (3-DoF) rotation estimate. An Iterative Closest Point (ICP) process then refines the initial rotation estimate and adds a translational component, yielding a full 6-DoF egomotion estimate. The focus of this work is to investigate the merits of using spherical harmonic analysis for egomotion estimation by comparison with alternative 6-DoF methods. We compare the performance of the proposed technique with that of stand-alone ICP and image feature based methods. As with other egomotion techniques, estimation errors accumulate and degrade results, necessitating correction mechanisms for robust localization. For this report, however, we use the raw estimates; no filtering or smoothing processes are applied. In-house and external benchmark data sets are analyzed for both runtime and accuracy. Results show that the algorithm is competitive in terms of both accuracy and runtime, and future work will aim to combine the various techniques into a more robust egomotion estimation framework.","1050-4729;10504729","Electronic:978-1-4673-1405-3; POD:978-1-4673-1403-9; USB:978-1-4673-1404-6","10.1109/ICRA.2012.6225098","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6225098","","Accuracy;Correlation;Estimation;Harmonic analysis;Iterative closest point algorithm;Runtime;Sensors","feature extraction;image sensors;motion estimation","6-DoF methods;RGB-D sensors;correction mechanisms;extended Gaussian image;image features;iterative closest point process;online egomotion estimation;robust localization;spherical harmonics","","3","","18","","","14-18 May 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

Given the boundary clouds of a target object and two fixed finger positions, our aim is to find potential third finger positions that can prevent target from escaping into infinity. The major challenge in working with boundary clouds lies in their uncertainty in geometric model fitting and the failure of critical orientations. In this paper, we track canonical motions according to the rotational intersection of Configuration space fingers and rasterize Work space with grids to compute the third caging positions. Our approach can generate the capture region with max(O(np),O(h<sup>2</sup>)) ≤ O(n<sup>2</sup>) cost where n denotes the resolution of grid rasterization, p denotes the resolution of canonical rasterization and h denotes the resolution of boundary rasterization or the number of boundary cloud points. Moreover, we propose a rough approximation which measures a subset of the possible positions by contracting rotations, indicating computational complexity of max(O(n),O(h<sup>2</sup>)). In the experimental part, our proposal is compared with state-of-the-art works and applied to many other objects.

To resolve the accuracy issues, a sensor based indirect error compensation approach is proposed in this paper where the errors are compensated online via measurements of the work object. The sensor captures a point cloud of the work object and with the CAD model of the work object, the actual relative pose of the sensor frame and work object frame can be established via a point cloud registration. Once this relationship has been established, the robot will be able to move the tool accurately relative to the work object frame near the point of compensation.

Thus the behavior patterns of individual nodes have seldom been studied. In this paper, we present new techniques for classifying behavior of nodes in terms of availability and compare them with naive manual classification. We apply a k-means clustering algorithm with various classification criteria on real trace data of a peer-to-peer system.

Achieving such system, requires strong perception method to efficiently update the frequently changing environment. We propose a method for mapping a household environment using multiple stereo and depth cameras located on the humanoid head and the environment. The method relies on colored 3D point cloud data computed from the sensors. We achieve robot localization by matching the point clouds from the robot sensor data directly with the environment sensor data. Object detection is performed using Iterative Closest Point (ICP) with a database of known point cloud models.

In V-SLAM the main focus is most often laid on the localization part of the problem allowing for a drift free motion estimate. To this end, a sparse set of landmarks is tracked and their position is estimated. However, this set of landmarks (rendering the map) is often too sparse for tasks in autonomous driving such as navigation, path planning, obstacle avoidance etc. Some methods keep the raw measurements for past robot poses to address the sparsity problem often resulting in a pose only SLAM akin to laser scanner SLAM. For the stereo case, this is however impractical due to the high noise of stereo reconstructed point clouds. In this paper we propose a dense stereo V-SLAM algorithm that estimates a dense 3D map representation which is more accurate than raw stereo measurements. Thereto, we run a sparse V SLAM system, take the resulting pose estimates to compute a locally dense representation from dense stereo correspondences. This dense representation is expressed in local coordinate systems which are tracked as part of the SLAM estimate. This allows the dense part to be continuously updated. Our system is driven by visual odometry priors to achieve high robustness when tracking landmarks. Moreover, the sparse part of the SLAM system uses recently published sub mapping techniques to achieve constant runtime complexity most of the time. The improved accuracy over raw stereo measurements is shown in a Monte Carlo simulation. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method by presenting outdoor experiments of a car like robot.","1050-4729;10504729","DVD:978-1-61284-380-3; Electronic:978-1-61284-385-8; POD:978-1-61284-386-5","10.1109/ICRA.2011.5979711","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5979711","","Accuracy;Cameras;Image reconstruction;Kalman filters;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Visualization","Monte Carlo methods;SLAM (robots);collision avoidance;image reconstruction;image representation;mobile robots;motion estimation;navigation;object tracking;pose estimation;road vehicles;robot vision;stereo image processing","Monte Carlo simulation;autonomous driving;autonomous ground vehicles;car like robot;dense 3D map representation;drift free motion estimate;landmark tracking;local coordinate system;navigation;obstacle avoidance;path planning;pose estimate;position estimation;robot pose;runtime complexity;simultaneous localization and mapping;sparsity problem;stereo reconstructed point clouds;submapping technique;visual SLAM;visual odometry","","29","3","32","","","9-13 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The environment is modeled as a set of curves and the variables of the optimization problem are the robot poses as well as the parameters describing the curves. There are two key differences between this SLAM formulation and existing SLAM methods. First, the environment is represented by continuous curves instead of point clouds or occupancy grids. Second, all the laser readings, including laser beams which returns its maximum range value, have been included in the objective function. As the objective function to be optimized contains discontinuities, it can not be solved by standard gradient based approaches and thus a Genetic Algorithm (GA) based method is applied. Matching of laser scans acquired from relatively far apart robot poses is achieved by applying GA on top of the Iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The new SLAM formulation and the use of a global optimization algorithm successfully avoid the convergence to local minimum for both the scan matching and the SLAM problem. Both simulated and experimental data are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.","1050-4729;10504729","DVD:978-1-61284-380-3; Electronic:978-1-61284-385-8; POD:978-1-61284-386-5","10.1109/ICRA.2011.5980504","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5980504","","Genetic algorithms;Iterative closest point algorithm;Lasers;Optimization;Simultaneous localization and mapping","SLAM (robots);convergence of numerical methods;genetic algorithms;grid computing;iterative methods;laser beam applications;mobile robots","feature based SLAM;genetic algorithm based method;gradient based approach;iterative closest point algorithm;laser beam;laser reading;laser sensor data;occupancy grid;optimization problem","","7","","18","","","9-13 May 2011","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

The infrared tracking system has been proved to be a valuable alternative to tracking system based on other technologies, such as magnetic, acoustic, gyroscopic and mechanical due to its precision and robustness. Often, markers attached to instruments for infrared tracking system are spherical and therefore not distinguishable, making identification targets from the points cloud necessary. Owing to the wear, tear or damage of the instrument in service, the relative position between the work point and the markers on instruments will change, which makes the instrument calibration before the application obbligato. This paper presents the effective algorithms for detecting the targets from the reconstructed 3D point cloud and estimating the relative position of work point to markers placed on the instrument.

The cumulative pose data provides a 3D point cloud that is quantized to the probabilistic volumetric map. For each voxel we have a probability distribution for the occupancy percentage. This is then extended to in-hand exploration of non-static objects. Since the object is moving during the in-hand exploration, and we also consider the use of the other hand for re-grasping, object pose has to be tracked. By keeping track of object motion we can register data to the initial pose to build a consistent object representation. An object centered representation is implemented using the computed object center of mass to define its frame of reference. Results are presented for in-hand exploration of both static and non-static objects that show that valid models can be obtained.

Many authors use it as a classical 3D sensor which provides a large tri-dimensional cloud of metric measurements, and apply methods usually designed for other sensors, such as clustering based on a distance. For stereo-vision, the measurement uncertainty is related to the range. For medium to long range, often necessary in the field of intelligent vehicles, this uncertainty has a significant impact, limiting the use of this kind of approaches. On the other hand, some authors consider stereo-vision more like a vision sensor and choose to directly work in the disparity space. This provides the ability to exploit the connectivity of the measurements, but roughly takes into consideration the actual size of the objects. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic representation of the specific uncertainty for stereo-vision, which takes advantage of both aspects - distance and disparity. The model is presented and then applied to obstacle detection, using the occupancy grid framework.

A further difficulty is that the transformations between views are in general not accurately known, a circumstance that multi-view object modeling algorithms do not handle properly under noisy conditions. In this work, we take into account both uncertainty sources (in images and camera poses) to generate spatially consistent 3D object models fusing multiple views with a probabilistic approach.

After a filtering step of the 3D point cloud, the dominant hypothetical facade planes are detected using an adapted Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform (PPHT). The corresponding planar clusters are extracted using a priori geometric knowledge of street. The clusters are horizontally and vertically delimited using heuristic approaches. The adapted PPHT allows the automatic extraction of georeferenced planar clusters of facades with a fine detection of dominant facade lines and a low computation time. The adopted approach has been tested on a set of point cloud acquired in the city of Paris under real conditions. Examples and experimental results show the efficiency and the potential of the proposed approach.","","Electronic:978-1-4244-6964-2; POD:978-1-4244-6963-5","10.1109/CRV.2010.23","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5479477","3D city modeling;3D point cloud;3D street reconstruction;Hough transform;terrestrial laser scanning","Cities and towns;Computer vision;Data mining;Image reconstruction;Laser modes;Robot sensing systems;Robot vision systems;Simultaneous localization and mapping;Three-dimensional displays;Urban areas","Hough transforms;cartography;mobile computing;robots","3D point clouds;a priori geometric knowledge;mobile mapping system;outlined planar clusters;progressive probabilistic Hough transform;robotic research;street facades;terrestrial laser data","","4","1","12","","","May 31 2010-June 2 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This approach offers an alternative to the traditional point-to-point iterative-closest-point (ICP) algorithm, its point-to-plane variant, as well as newer grid-based algorithms, such as the 3-D normal distribution transform (NDT). The simpler case of known plane correspondences is tackled first by deriving expressions for least-squares pose estimation considering plane-parameter uncertainty computed during plane extraction. Closed-form expressions for covariances are also derived. To round-off the solution, we present a new algorithm, which is called minimally uncertain maximal consensus (MUMC), to determine the unknown plane correspondences by maximizing geometric consistency by minimizing the uncertainty volume in configuration space. Experimental results from three 3-D sensors, viz., Swiss-Ranger, University of South Florida Odetics Laser Detection and Ranging, and an actuated SICK S300, are given. The first two have low fields of view (FOV) and moderate ranges, while the third has a much bigger FOV and range. Experimental results show that this approach is not only more robust than point- or grid-based approaches in plane-rich environments, but it is also faster, requires significantly less memory, and offers a less-cluttered planar-patches-based visualization.","1552-3098;15523098","","10.1109/TRO.2010.2042989","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5431057","Localization;mapping;planes-based pose registration;sensor fusion;simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)","","image registration;least squares approximations;normal distribution;pose estimation;robots","3D mapping;3D normal distribution transform;3D sensor;fast registration;geometric consistency;large planar-surface;least-squares pose estimation;minimally uncertain maximal consensus;noisy planes;plane extraction;plane-parameter uncertainty;point clouds;point-to-point iterative-closest-point algorithm;robot-pose-registration","","86","","39","","20100315","June 2010","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

One frequently encountered problem in these settings occurs when the target's movement pattern changes unexpectedly; such as when the target turns around, enters a room from a corridor or turns left or right at an intersection. If the particle filter makes an incorrect prediction, it might not be able to recover using the normal techniques of prediction, weight update and resampling. We propose an approach to automatically restart the particle filter by sampling the latest trusted observation when the particle cloud diverges too much from the observations. The restart decision is based on Kullback-Leibler divergence between the probability surfaces associated with the current observation and the particle cloud. Through an experimental study we show that the restart algorithm allows the successful early recovery of stranded particle filters, in our scenarios providing a 36% average improvement in localization accuracy.","1930-529X;1930529X","Electronic:978-1-4244-4148-8; POD:978-1-4244-4147-1; POD:978-1-4244-4148-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5426067","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5426067","","Clouds;Computer science;Indoor environments;Mobile computing;Particle filters;Particle tracking;Robot sensing systems;Robotics and automation;Sampling methods;Target tracking","indoor communication;particle filtering (numerical methods);radio tracking","Kullback-Leibler divergence;dynamic indoor localization;mobile target tracking;restarting particle filters","","11","","22","","","Nov. 30 2009-Dec. 4 2009","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

This method also provides covariance matrices for the pose-registration result. Based on this registration algorithm, a relaxation method utilizing these covariances is formulated. In particular, we exploit the plane-matcher properties that it provides an accurate rotation estimate, and that it can easily identify principal translational directions of uncertainty, to relax only the translation errors.

The parameters in question are the plane's normal and its distance to the origin. The range standard-deviation model used by us is a quadratic function of the true range and is a function of the incidence angle as well. We show that for this model, the maximum-likelihood plane is biased, whereas the least-squares plane is not. The plane-parameters' covariance matrix for the least-squares plane is shown to possess a number of desirable properties, e.g., the optimal solution forms its null-space and its components are functions of easily understood terms like the planar-patch's center and scatter. We verify our covariance expression with that obtained by the eigenvector perturbation method. We further compare our method to that of renormalization with respect to the theoretically best covariance matrix in simulation. The application of our approach to real-time range-image registration and plane fusion is shown by an example using a commercially available 3D range sensor.

The rover global localization scenario was conducted in the Mars Yard located at the Canadian Space Agency. The experimental results using natural environment data sensed by a high resolution and accurate 3D range sensor (LIDAR), demonstrate the effectiveness our enhanced matching algorithm","2153-0858;21530858","CD-ROM:1-4244-0259-X; POD:1-4244-0258-1","10.1109/IROS.2006.281899","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4059056","3-D Localization;Autonomous Navigation;Spin-image;Terrain Registration;fingerprint","Clouds;Computer vision;Fingerprint recognition;Geometry;Image reconstruction;Intelligent robots;Laser radar;Mars;Navigation;Space technology","aerospace robotics;image matching;image registration;mobile robots;path planning;planetary rovers;robot vision","3D range sensor;3D terrain registration;Canadian Space Agency;computer vision;local features-based registration algorithms;point fingerprint matching;rover localization;spin-image matching","","2","","16","","","9-15 Oct. 2006","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

In contrast to established tracking algorithms based on homographies the surface is not modeled as planar or piecewise planar but as a collection of 3D surface points and surface normals. Thus, any free-form surface can be modeled. This paper introduces a novel description of the image Jacobian in terms of a reference Jacobian based on the image-constancy (IC) assumption in 3D.

Approximation algorithms for this searching, namely, approximate kd-trees and box decomposition trees, are presented and evaluated in this paper.

We assume the camera motion to be unknown or at least uncertain. An example application is the registration of endoscope images to pre-operative CT scans that allows instrument navigation during surgical procedures. The application field is not restricted to the medical field. It can be extended to registration of monocular video images to laser-based surface reconstructions in, e.g., mobile navigation area or to autonomous aircraft navigation from topological surveys. A novel way for depth estimation from arbitrary camera motion is presented. In this paper, we focus on the robust initialization of the system and on the scale recovery for the reconstructed 3D point clouds with accurate registration to the candidate surfaces extracted from the CT data. We provide experimental validation of the algorithm with data obtained from our experiments with a phantom skull.","","POD:0-7803-8463-6","10.1109/IROS.2004.1389797","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1389797","","Aircraft navigation;Biomedical imaging;Cameras;Computed tomography;Endoscopes;Image reconstruction;Laser surgery;Surface emitting lasers;Surface reconstruction;Surgical instruments","endoscopes;image reconstruction;medical robotics;robot vision;stereo image processing;video signal processing","3D surface model;CT scan;arbitrary camera motion;depth estimation;endoscopic camera;laser-based surface reconstructions;monocular stereo images;scale-invariant registration","","2","6","11","","","28 Sept.-2 Oct. 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

First, the best local alignment between successive point clouds is computed by a fast ego-motion/action-estimation algorithm which relies on an incremental matches filtering process followed by energy minimization. Then, a quasi-random updating algorithm, a kind of multi-view ICP, minimizes the global inconsistency of the map. Such an inconsistency is defined in terms of the sum of local inconsistencies and an additional entropy-based regularization term which is effective in plane-parallel environments. For the sake of efficiency, we assume a flat floor and a fixed stereo camera mounted on the robot. We have successfully tested the approach by performing several indoor mapping experiments.","1050-4729;10504729","POD:0-7803-8232-3","10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1307987","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1307987","","Cameras;Filtering algorithms;Iterative closest point algorithm;Matched filters;Minimization methods;Robot vision systems;Stereo vision;Terrain mapping;Three-dimensional displays","entropy;mobile robots;motion estimation;robot vision;stereo image processing","3D map building method;action estimation algorithm;ego motion algorithm;energy minimization;entropy-based regularization;incremental matches filtering process;indoor mapping experiments;plane-parallel environments;quasirandom updating algorithm;robot;stereo camera;stereo vision","","17","","18","","","April 26 2004-May 1 2004","","IEEE","IEEE Conference Publications"

""Being connected"" becomes an essential part of our daily life. Regarding wireless communications, we have reached a new turning point, where Long Term Evolution (LTE) started commercial service in many countries and smart phones are rapidly spreading out in the market. We believe there will be four essential components that support future wireless systems and applications: user experience, user interface, connectivity, and clouds. The user experience goes far beyond our forecast. Users continuously need not just human-to-human (H2H) information exchange, but also machine-to-human (M2H), device-to-device (D2D), and machine-to-machine (M2M) communications. The spatial and temporal connectivity becomes a key engineering task, where one single system cannot achieve both connectivity and high capacity. Instead, heterogeneous wireless systems coexist to provide spectrally efficient and economical services. With constraints on memory and computing power of mobile terminals, the cloud servers are now core parts of networking in academia and industry.","0890-8044;08908044","","10.1109/MNET.2012.6201209","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6201209","","Networked control systems;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Special issues and sections;Wireless communication","","","","0","","","","","May-June 2012","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"
